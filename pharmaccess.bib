  abstract = {This paper argues that the data warehouse architecture as we know it today will wither in the coming years and be replaced by a new architectural pattern, the Lakehouse, which will (i) be based on open direct-access data formats, such as Apache Parquet, (ii) have firstclass support for machine learning and data science, and (iii) offer state-of-the-art performance. Lakehouses can help address several major challenges with data warehouses, including data staleness, reliability, total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support. We discuss how the industry is already moving toward Lakehouses and how this shift may affect work in data management. We also report results from a Lakehouse system using Parquet that is competitive with popular cloud data warehouses on TPC-DS.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the great impact of information and communication technologies on clinical practice and on the quality of health services, this trend has been almost exclusive to developed countries, whereas countries with poor resources suffer from many economic and social issues that have hindered the real benefits of electronic health (eHealth) tools. As a component of eHealth systems, electronic health records (EHRs) play a fundamental role in patient management and effective medical care services. Thus, the adoption of EHRs in regions with a lack of infrastructure, untrained staff, and ill-equipped health care providers is an important task. However, the main barrier to adopting EHR software in low- and middle-income countries is the cost of its purchase and maintenance, which highlights the open-source approach as a good solution for these underserved areas. Objective The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of open-source EHR systems based on the requirements and limitations of low-resource settings. Methods First, we reviewed existing literature on the comparison of available open-source solutions. In close collaboration with the University of Gondar Hospital, Ethiopia, we identified common limitations in poor resource environments and also the main requirements that EHRs should support. Then, we extensively evaluated the current open-source EHR solutions, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, and their appropriateness to fulfill a predefined set of features relevant for low-resource settings. Results The evaluation methodology allowed assessment of several key aspects of available solutions that are as follows: (1) integrated applications, (2) configurable reports, (3) custom reports, (4) custom forms, (5) interoperability, (6) coding systems, (7) authentication methods, (8) patient portal, (9) access control model, (10) cryptographic features, (11) flexible data model, (12) offline support, (13) native client, (14) Web client,(15) other clients, (16) code-based language, (17) development activity, (18) modularity, (19) user interface, (20) community support, and (21) customization. The quality of each feature is discussed for each of the evaluated solutions and a final comparison is presented. Conclusions There is a clear demand for open-source, reliable, and flexible EHR systems in low-resource settings. In this study, we have evaluated and compared five open-source EHR systems following a multidimensional methodology that can provide informed recommendations to other implementers, developers, and health care professionals. We hope that the results of this comparison can guide decision making when needing to adopt, install, and maintain an open-source EHR solution in low-resource settings.},

  abstract = {In recent years, all major consumer technology corporations have moved into the domain of health research. This `Googlization of health research' (`GHR') begs the question of how the common good will be served in this research. As critical data scholars contend, such phenomena must be situated within the political economy of digital capitalism in order to foreground the question of public interest and the common good. Here, trends like GHR are framed within a double, incommensurable logic, where private gain and economic value are pitted against public good and societal value. While helpful for highlighting the exploitative potential of digital capitalism, this framing is limiting, insofar as it acknowledges only one conception of the common good. This article uses the analytical framework of modes of justification developed by Boltanksi and Th{\'e}venot to identify a plurality of orders of worth and conceptualizations of the common good at work in GHR. Not just the `civic' (doing good for society) and `market' (enhancing wealth creation) orders, but also an `industrial' (increasing efficiency), a `project' (innovation and experimentation), and what I call a `vitalist' (proliferating life) order. Using promotional material of GHR initiatives and preliminary interviews with participants in GHR projects, I ask what moral orientations guide different actors in GHR. Engaging seriously with these different conceptions of the common good is paramount. First, in order to critically evaluate them and explicate what is at stake in the move towards GHR, and ultimately, in order to develop viable governance solutions that ensure strong `civic' components.},

  abstract = {Background Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.},

Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n\,=\,66, 32.5\%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n\,=\,30, 14.8\%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n\,=\,24, 11.8\%), general research data sharing (n\,=\,23, 11.3\%), and management of genomic data (n\,=\,21, 10.3\%). With the exception of phenotyping (n\,=\,19, 9.4\%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself.Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities.The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.},

  abstract = {In low-and middle-income countries, achieving universal health coverage remains challenging due to insufficient, temporary and fragmented funding as well as limited accessibility to quality healthcare. Leveraging a mobile health platform can be a powerful tool to address these problems. This paper demonstrates how analysing data collected from a mobile health platform helps optimize healthcare provider networks, monitor patient flows and assess the quality and equitability of access to care. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the importance of real-time data on health-seeking behaviour. Between 2018 and 2019, as a Kenyan universal health coverage pilot was being planned, Kisumu County, with support from PharmAccess Foundation, implemented household-level digital registration for healthcare and collected socio-economic and healthcare claims data using the M-TIBA platform. In total, 273,350 Kisumu households enrolled. The claims data showed many patients visit higher-level facilities for ailments, that can be treated at primary care levels, unnecessarily. High-level estimate of the disease burden at participating facilities revealed rampant overprescription of pertinent medicines for highly prevalent malaria and respiratory tract infections, exemplifying clinical management deficiencies. M-TIBA data allowed tracking of individual patient trajectories. Analyses of data are shown at the aggregate level. The paper shows how mobile health platforms can be used to generate valuable insights into access to and quality of care. Funding for healthcare can be united through mobile health platforms, limiting the fragmentation in funding. They can be useful for funders, health managers and policymakers to improve the implementation of universal health coverage programs in low-and middle-income countries.},

They are being used for a widening range of functions from diagnostics to health insurance to treatment advice, generating hopes for new healthcare futures and establishing the region as an emerging hub of experimentation in digital health. Drawing on our on-going ethnographic and anthropological research in Kenya and Tanzania, this article explores the dynamic, varied, experimental, and increasingly financialised terrain of formal digital health projects. While innovation in digital health is a growing feature of healthcare across the globe, in East Africa it is entering into a region already long characterised by NGOised, fragmented and vertical healthcare systems and heavy dependence on foreign capital. This presents challenges to efforts, including the WHO's Universal Health Coverage agenda, to foster national and equitable public healthcare systems. In exploring these issues, we recognise the power, and often deleterious effects, of financial capital that foregrounds markets in global digital health, but we also open space for a (still critical) recognition of East African-led digital and data technology movements.},

  abstract = {In Kenya, early coronavirus disease (COVID-19) modeling studies predicted that disruptions in antenatal care and hospital services could increase indirect maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths. As the Kenyan government enforced lockdowns and a curfew, many mothers-to-be were unable to safely reach hospital facilities, especially at night. Fear of contracting COVID-19, increasing costs of accessing care, stigma, and falling incomes forced many expectant mothers to give birth at home. MomCare, which primarily serves communities in remote areas and urban slums, links mothers-to-be with payers and health care providers, following a standardized pregnancy program based on World Health Organization guidelines at a predetermined cost and quality. Expectant mothers gain access to care through a mobile wallet on their feature phone (voice, text, and basic internet), and providers are paid after appropriate care is given. Within the first 3 weeks of the pandemic in Kenya, the following services were added to the MomCare bundle: emergency ambulance services during curfew hours, extended bed allowances to encourage early care, phone calls to check on mothers approaching their delivery dates and to promote the generation of a birth plan, SMS messages to inform mothers of open facilities and COVID-19 protocols, and training for clinic staff in managing COVID-19 patients and infection prevention. We compare data collected through the MomCare platform during the 6 months before the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Kenya (September 2019--February 2020) with data collected during the 6 months that followed. This study shows that care-seeking behaviors (enrollment, antenatal/postnatal care, skilled deliveries) increased for mothers-to-be enrolled in MomCare during the COVID-19 lockdowns, while quality of care and outcomes were maintained. Public health practitioners can promote interactive, patient-driven technology like MomCare to augment traditional responses, quickly linking payments with patients and providers in times of crisis.},

Our focus is predominantly on the value of and concerns with regard to the application of digital health within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is in LMICs and marginalized communities that mHealth (within the wider scope of digital health) could be most useful and valuable. Peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs provides reassurance of this potential, often reflecting on the ubiquity of mobile phones and ever-increasing connectivity globally, reaching remote or otherwise disengaged populations. Efforts to adapt successful programs for LMIC contexts and populations are only just starting to reap rewards. Private-sector investment in mHealth offers value through enhanced capacity and advances in technology as well as the ability to meet increasing consumer demand for real-time, accessible, convenient, and choice-driven health care options. We examine some of the potential considerations associated with a private-sector investment, questioning whether a core of transparency, local ownership, equity, and safety is likely to be upheld in the current environment of health entrepreneurship.},

Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?},

From those differentiating characteristics, we identify areas for future work: (1) The specific characteristics of data require reconceptualizing the object of platform openness; (2) New ways in which data platforms can be opened should be conceptualized; (3) As data platforms are tailored to specific industries, platform-to-platform openness should be a novel unit of analysis; (4) Because opening up data platforms create novel risks, new reasons to (not) open up data platforms should be studied.},

  abstract = {Background: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as ``Public Health \&amp; Research'' and ``Evidence-Based Medicine'' while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research. Objective: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions. Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. Results: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73\%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6\%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20\%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29\%, n=14), standardization of data (41\%, n=20), analysis (12\%, n=6), recruitment (14\%, n=7), and consent management (4\%, n=2). Most (55\%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55\% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63\%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29\%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37\%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18\%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12\%, n=6), and others (43\%, n=21). Only 4 (8\%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain ``Public Health \&amp; Research.'' Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server. Conclusions: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.},

However, healthcare data can be sensitive in nature and as such difficult to share and make use for secondary purposes. Healthcare vendors are restricted to share data without proper consent from the patient. There is a rising awareness among individual patients as well regarding sharing their personal information due to ethical, legal and societal problems. The current data-sharing platforms in healthcare do not sufficiently handle these issues. The rationale of the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach shifts the focus from sharing data to sharing processing/analysis applications and their respective results. A prerequisite of the PHT-infrastructure is that the data is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The aim of the paper is to describe a methodology of finding the number of patients diagnosed with hypertension and calculate cohort statistics in a privacy-preserving federated manner. The whole process completes without individual patient data leaving the source. For this, we rely on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.},

Advanced analytics could power the data collected from numerous sources, both from healthcare institutions, or generated by individuals themselves via apps and devices, and lead to innovations in treatment and diagnosis of diseases; improve the care given to the patient; and empower citizens to participate in the decision-making process regarding their own health and well-being. However, the sensitive nature of the health data prohibits healthcare organizations from sharing the data. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is a novel approach, aiming to establish a distributed data analytics infrastructure enabling the (re)use of distributed healthcare data, while data owners stay in control of their own data. The main principle of the PHT is that data remain in their original location, and analytical tasks visit data sources and execute the tasks. The PHT provides a distributed, flexible approach to use data in a network of participants, incorporating the FAIR principles. It facilitates the responsible use of sensitive and/or personal data by adopting international principles and regulations. This paper presents the concepts and main components of the PHT and demonstrates how it complies with FAIR principles.},

We theorize how the ongoing technological developments reinforce the traditional functions of data as instruments of management and control but also reframe and extend their role. By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulfil in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, and physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns, and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative significance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.},

To address the `big data' problems due to high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity, data management systems evolved from structured databases to big data storage systems, graph databases, data warehouses, and data lakes but each solution has its strengths and shortcomings. The need to produce actionable knowledge fast from unstructured data ingested from distributed sources requires a marriage of data warehouses and data lakes to create a data Lakehouse (LH). The objective is to use the strengths of the data warehouse in producing insights fast from processed merged data, and of the data lake in ingesting and storing high-speed unstructured data with post-storage transformation and analytics capabilities. In this paper, we present a comparative review of the existing data warehouse and data lake technology to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and propose the desired and necessary features of the LH architecture, which has recently gained a lot of attention in the big data management research community.},

  abstract = {The construction of systems supporting spatial data has experienced great enthusiasm in the past, due to the richness of this type of data and their semantics, which can be used in the decision-making process in various fields. Thus, the problem of integrating spatial data into existing databases and information systems has been addressed by creating spatial extensions to relational tables or by creating spatial data warehouses, while arranging data structures and query languages by making them more spatially-aware. With the advent of Big Data, these conventional storage and spatial representation structures are becoming increasingly outdated, and required a new organization of spatial data. Approaches based on distributed storage and data lakes have been proposed, to integrate the complexity of spatial data, with operational and analytical systems which unfortunately quickly showed their limits. Recently the concept of lakehouse was introduced in order to integrate, among other things, the notion of reliability and ACID properties to the volume of data to be managed. This new data architecture is a combination of governed and reliable Data Warehouses and flexible, scalable and cost-effective Data Lakes. In this paper, we present how traditional approaches of spatial data management in the context of spatial big data have quickly shown their limits. We present a literature overview of these approaches, and how they led to the Data LakeHouse. We detail how the Lakehouse paradigm can be used and extended for managing spatial big data, by giving the different components and best practices for building a spatial data LakeHouse architecture optimized for the storage and computing over spatial big data.},

  abstract = {Lack of interoperability and integration between heterogeneous health systems is a big challenge to realize the potential benefits of eHealth. To best move from siloed applications to interoperable eHealth solutions, health information exchange (HIE) policy and standards are necessary to be established. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the current status of HIE policy and standards on the African continent. Therefore, this paper aimed to systematically review the status of HIE policy and standards which are currently in practice in Africa. A systematic search of the literature was conducted from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Scopus, Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and a total of 32 papers (21 strategic documents and 11 peer-reviewed papers) were selected based on predefined criteria for synthesis. Results revealed that African countries have paid attention to the development, improvement, adoption, and implementation of HIE architecture for interoperability and standards. Synthetic and semantic interoperability standards were identified for the implementation of HIE in Africa. Based on this comprehensive review, we recommend that comprehensive interoperable technical standards should be set at each national level and should be guided by appropriate governance and legal frameworks, data ownership and use agreements, and health data privacy and security guidelines. On top of the policy issues, there is a need to identify a set of standards (health system standards, communication, messaging standards, terminology/vocabulary standards, patient profile standards, privacy and security, and risk assessment) and implement them throughout all levels of the health system. On top of this, we recommend that the Africa Union (AU) and regional bodies provide the necessary human resource and high-level technical support to African countries to implement HIE policy and standards. To realize the full potential of eHealth in the continent, it is recommended that African countries need to have a common HIE policy, interoperable technical standards, and health data privacy and security guidelines. Currently, there is an ongoing effort by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) towards promoting HIE on the continent. A task force has been established from Africa CDC, Health Information Service Provider (HISP) partners, and African and global HIE subject matter experts to provide expertise and guidance in the development of AU policy and standards for HIE. Although the work is still ongoing, the African Union shall continue to support the implementation of HIE policy and standards in the continent. The authors of this review are currently working under the umbrella of the African Union to develop the HIE policy and standard to be endorsed by the head of states of the Africa Union. As a follow-up publication to this, the result will be published in mid-2022.},

  abstract = {Background Sharing health data is challenging because of several technical, ethical, and regulatory issues. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have been conceptualized to enable data interoperability. Many studies provide implementation guidelines, assessment metrics, and software to achieve FAIR-compliant data, especially for health data sets. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health data content modeling and exchange standard. Objective Our goal was to devise a new methodology to extract, transform, and load existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR repositories in line with FAIR principles, develop a Data Curation Tool to implement the methodology, and evaluate it on health data sets from 2 different but complementary institutions. We aimed to increase the level of compliance with FAIR principles of existing health data sets through standardization and facilitate health data sharing by eliminating the associated technical barriers. Methods Our approach automatically processes the capabilities of a given FHIR end point and directs the user while configuring mappings according to the rules enforced by FHIR profile definitions. Code system mappings can be configured for terminology translations through automatic use of FHIR resources. The validity of the created FHIR resources can be automatically checked, and the software does not allow invalid resources to be persisted. At each stage of our data transformation methodology, we used particular FHIR-based techniques so that the resulting data set could be evaluated as FAIR. We performed a data-centric evaluation of our methodology on health data sets from 2 different institutions. Results Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users are prompted to configure the mappings into FHIR resource types with respect to the restrictions of selected profiles. Once the mappings are developed, our approach can syntactically and semantically transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility according to our privacy-concerned criteria. In addition to the mapped resource types, behind the scenes, we create additional FHIR resources to satisfy several FAIR criteria. According to the data maturity indicators and evaluation methods of the FAIR Data Maturity Model, we achieved the maximum level (level 5) for being Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable and level 3 for being Reusable. Conclusions We developed and extensively evaluated our data transformation approach to unlock the value of existing health data residing in disparate data silos to make them available for sharing according to the FAIR principles. We showed that our method can successfully transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility, and the result is FAIR in terms of the FAIR Data Maturity Model. We support institutional migration to HL7 FHIR, which not only leads to FAIR data sharing but also eases the integration with different research networks.},

  abstract = {The requirement for specialization in data management systems has evolved faster than our software development practices. After decades of organic growth, this situation has created a siloed landscape composed of hundreds of products developed and maintained as monoliths, with limited reuse between systems. This fragmentation has resulted in developers often reinventing the wheel, increased maintenance costs, and slowed down innovation. It has also affected the end users, who are often required to learn the idiosyncrasies of dozens of incompatible SQL and non-SQL API dialects, and settle for systems with incomplete functionality and inconsistent semantics. In this vision paper, considering the recent popularity of open source projects aimed at standardizing different aspects of the data stack, we advocate for a paradigm shift in how data management systems are designed. We believe that by decomposing these into a modular stack of reusable components, development can be streamlined while creating a more consistent experience for users. Towards that goal, we describe the state-ofthe-art, principal open source technologies, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will foster collaboration, motivate further research, and promote a more composable future for data management.},

Software code, documentation, and technical documents were released under an open-source license. Multi-modal federated averaging is illustrated using the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. To date, 8 out of the 9 participating sites have successfully deployed the platform, with a total enrolment of \&gt;1M patients. Mapping data from legacy systems to FHIR was the biggest barrier to implementation.The CODA platform was developed and successfully deployed in a public healthcare setting in Canada, with heterogeneous information technology systems and capabilities. Ongoing efforts will use the platform to develop and prospectively validate models for risk assessment, proactive monitoring, and resource usage. Further work will also make tools available to facilitate migration from legacy formats to FHIR and DICOM.},

We designed several workflows for patient clinical data used in two hospital information systems, namely patient registration and laboratory information systems.

We developed an FHIR database implementation that utilizes FHIR APIs and a range of operations to facilitate descriptive data analytics (DDA) and patient cohort selection. A prototype user interface for DDA was developed with support for visualizing healthcare data analysis results in various forms.

The framework treats scalability as a multi-criteria optimization problem and captures the dependency relationships that underlie typical notions of scalability.

First, limitations of available implementation technology may force a specification change. For example, deciding to implement a stack as an array (rather than as a linked list) may impose a fixed limit on the depth of the stack. Second, implementation choices may suggest augmentations to the original specification. For example, deciding to use an existing pattern-match routine to implement the search command in an editor may lead to incorporating some of the routine's features into the specification, such as the ability to include wild cards in the search key. This paper elaborates these points and illustrates how they arise in the specification of a controller for a package router.},

In contrast to traditional `schema-on-write' approaches such as data warehouses, data lakes are repositories storing raw data in its original formats and providing a common access interface. Despite the strong interest raised from both academia and industry, there is a large body of ambiguity regarding the definition, functions and available technologies for data lakes. A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes. We hope that the thorough comparison of existing solutions and the discussion of open research challenges in this survey will motivate the future development of data lake research and practice.},

  abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems designed for Online Analytical Processing (RDBMS-OLAP) have been foundational to democratizing data and enabling analytical use cases such as business intelligence and reporting for many years. However, RDBMS-OLAP systems present some well-known challenges. They are primarily optimized only for relational workloads, lead to proliferation of data copies which can become unmanageable, and since the data is stored in proprietary formats, it can lead to vendor lock-in, restricting access to engines, tools, and capabilities beyond what the vendor offers. As the demand for data-driven decision making surges, the need for a more robust data architecture to address these challenges becomes ever more critical. Cloud data lakes have addressed some of the shortcomings of RDBMS-OLAP systems, but they present their own set of challenges. More recently, organizations have often followed a two-tier architectural approach to take advantage of both these platforms, leveraging both cloud data lakes and RDBMS-OLAP systems. However, this approach brings additional challenges, complexities, and overhead. This paper discusses how a data lakehouse, a new architectural approach, achieves the same benefits of an RDBMS-OLAP and cloud data lake combined, while also providing additional advantages. We take today's data warehousing and break it down into implementation independent components, capabilities, and practices. We then take these aspects and show how a lakehouse architecture satisfies them. Then, we go a step further and discuss what additional capabilities and benefits a lakehouse architecture provides over an RDBMS-OLAP.},

To achieve this, it is essential for health data platforms to incorporate standards that facilitate addressing needs such as formal modeling of clinical knowledge (health domain concepts) as well as the harmonized persistence, query, and exchange of data across different information systems and organizations. However, the selection of these specifications has not been consistent across the different health data initiatives, often applying standards to address needs for which they were not originally designed. This issue is essential in the current scenario of implementing the European Health Data Space, which advocates harmonization, interoperability, and reuse of data without regulating the specific standards to be applied for this purpose. Therefore, this viewpoint aims to establish a coherent, agnostic, and homogeneous framework for the use of the most impactful EHR standards in the new-generation health data spaces: OpenEHR, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13606, and Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Thus, a panel of EHR standards experts has discussed several critical points to reach a consensus that will serve decision-making teams in health data platform projects who may not be experts in these EHR standards. It was concluded that these specifications possess different capabilities related to modeling, flexibility, and implementation resources. Because of this, in the design of future data platforms, these standards must be applied based on the specific needs they were designed for, being likewise fully compatible with their combined functional and technical implementation.},

  abstract = {Federated learning initiatives in healthcare are being developed to collaboratively train predictive models without the need to centralize sensitive personal data. GenoMed4All is one such project, with the goal of connecting European clinical and --omics data repositories on rare diseases through a federated learning platform. Currently, the consortium faces the challenge of a lack of well-established international datasets and interoperability standards for federated learning applications on rare diseases. This paper presents our practical approach to select and implement a Common Data Model (CDM) suitable for the federated training of predictive models applied to the medical domain, during the initial design phase of our federated learning platform. We describe our selection process, composed of identifying the consortium's needs, reviewing our functional and technical architecture specifications, and extracting a list of business requirements. We review the state of the art and evaluate three widely-used approaches (FHIR, OMOP and Phenopackets) based on a checklist of requirements and specifications. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach considering the use cases specific to our consortium as well as the generic issues of implementing a European federated learning healthcare platform. A list of lessons learned from the experience in our consortium is discussed, from the importance of establishing the proper communication channels for all stakeholders to technical aspects related to --omics data. For federated learning projects focused on secondary use of health data for predictive modeling, encompassing multiple data modalities, a phase of data model convergence is sorely needed to gather different data representations developed in the context of medical research, interoperability of clinical care software, imaging, and --omics analysis into a coherent, unified data model. Our work identifies this need and presents our experience and a list of actionable lessons learned for future work in this direction.},

Data governance is often a red herring which distracts from other digital problems. The governance of digital society cannot rely exclusively on data-centric economic models. We review the literatures and the underlying empirical and political claims concerning data commons. While commons thinking is useful to frame digital problems in terms of ecologies, it has important limitations. We propose a political-ecological approach to governing the digital society, defined by ecological thinking about governance problems and the awareness of the political nature of framing the problems and mapping their ecological makeup.},

  abstract = {Background Digital health solutions are a potent and complementary intervention in health system strengthening to accelerate universal access to health services. Implementing scalable, sustainable, and integrated digital solutions in a coordinated manner is necessary to experience the benefits of digital interventions in health systems. We sought to establish the breadth and scope of available digital health interventions (DHIs) and their functions in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the Joanne Briggs Institute's reviewers manual and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and explanation. We retrieved data from the WHO Digital Health Atlas (DHA), the WHO e-Health country profiles report of 2015, and electronic databases. The protocol has been deposited in an open-source platform -- the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/5kzq7. Results The researchers retrieved 983 digital tools used to strengthen health systems in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 10 years. We included 738 DHIs in the analysis while 245 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. We observed a disproportionate distribution of DHIs towards service delivery (81.7\%, n\,=\,603), health care providers (91.8\%, n\,=\,678), and access and use of information (84.1\%, n\,=\,621). Fifty-three percent (53.4\%, n\,=\,394) of the solutions are established and 47.5\% (n\,=\,582) were aligned to 20\% (n\,=\,5) of the system categories. Conclusions Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed with digital health solutions in both numbers and distinct functions. It is lacking in coordination, integration, scalability, sustainability, and equitable distribution of investments in digital health. Digital health policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa need to urgently institute coordination mechanisms to terminate unending duplication and disjointed vertical implementations and manage solutions for scale. Central to this would be to build digital health leadership in countries within SSA, adopt standards and interoperability frameworks; advocate for more investments into lagging components, and promote multi-purpose solutions to halt the seeming ``e-chaos'' and progress to sustainable e-health solutions.},

  abstract = {Multisite medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research. The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data utility. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely upon bespoke data sharing contracts. The lengthy process and administration induced by these contracts increases the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research.  This paper provides a synthesis between 2 novel advanced privacy-enhancing technologies---homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (defined together as multiparty homomorphic encryption). These privacy-enhancing technologies provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with multiparty homomorphic encryption providing a performance advantage over separately using homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation. We argue multiparty homomorphic encryption fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using multiparty homomorphic encryption can be considered anonymized data. We explain how multiparty homomorphic encryption can reduce the reliance upon customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research while offering additional incentives for health care and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.},

  abstract = {In today's binary world, digital health is of paramount importance, primarily due to the prevalence of IoT devices, upsurging health costs, growing elderly population, and shortage of clinical providers, to name a few. In light of these, providing efficient and smarter full-stack healthcare data analytics to manage and process healthcare data is a crucial topic from both academic and professional perspectives. The key goals of this full-stack healthcare data analytics are to detect health issues and promote human-being health proactively. The existing healthcare data analytics stacks are generally classified into commercial or open-source solutions. In designing a healthcare data stack, it is critical to offer the researchers a collaborative, modular, easy-to-use, cost/time-effective, reproducible, uniform, and shared- knowledge framework. Such healthcare stacks need to pave the way for researchers to focus on developing data analytics algorithms, and the underlying infrastructure should comply with longitudinal characteristics of healthcare data. Nonetheless, the existing healthcare data analytics stacks need holistically incorporate all the parameters mentioned. In this paper, we propose a novel healthcare data analytics stack called Open-Source Portable Healthcare Analytics Stack (PHAS) to address this issue. PHAS considers the mentioned features by fusing the merits of open-source and commercial solutions at the right place in its architecture. PHAS proposes a new shared-knowledge and time-series-aware framework, which enables researchers to perform health data collection, integration, storage, visualization, and analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the capabilities of the PHAS framework by implementing an anomaly detection algorithm for heart rate and blood pressure anomaly detection using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. We provide open-source PHAS for the community to integrate into their solutions.},

  abstract = {Background: The increasing use of electronic health records and the Internet of Things has led to interoperability issues at different levels (structural and semantic). Standards are important not only for successfully exchanging data but also for appropriately interpreting them (semantic interoperability). Thus, to facilitate the semantic interoperability of data exchanged in health care, considerable resources have been deployed to improve the quality of shared clinical data by structuring and mapping them to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Objective: The aims of this study are 2-fold: to inventory the studies on FHIR semantic interoperability resources and terminologies and to identify and classify the approaches and contributions proposed in these studies. Methods: A systematic mapping review (SMR) was conducted using 10 electronic databases as sources of information for inventory and review studies published during 2012 to 2022 on the development and improvement of semantic interoperability using the FHIR standard. Results: A total of 70 FHIR studies were selected and analyzed to identify FHIR resource types and terminologies from a semantic perspective. The proposed semantic approaches were classified into 6 categories, namely mapping (31/126, 24.6\%), terminology services (18/126, 14.3\%), resource description framework or web ontology language--based proposals (24/126, 19\%), annotation proposals (18/126, 14.3\%), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) proposals (20/126, 15.9\%), and ontology-based proposals (15/126, 11.9\%). From 2012 to 2022, there has been continued research in 6 categories of approaches as well as in new and emerging annotations and ML and NLP proposals. This SMR also classifies the contributions of the selected studies into 5 categories: framework or architecture proposals, model proposals, technique proposals, comparison services, and tool proposals. The most frequent type of contribution is the proposal of a framework or architecture to enable semantic interoperability. Conclusions: This SMR provides a classification of the different solutions proposed to address semantic interoperability using FHIR at different levels: collecting, extracting and annotating data, modeling electronic health record data from legacy systems, and applying transformation and mapping to FHIR models and terminologies. The use of ML and NLP for unstructured data is promising and has been applied to specific use case scenarios. In addition, terminology services are needed to accelerate their use and adoption; furthermore, techniques and tools to automate annotation and ontology comparison should help reduce human interaction.},

However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

The internet permits data of various forms to be transmitted from entity to entity; this being an important feature of information age. The ability to take advantage of this technology to improve all aspects of human life and human endeavor is one of the keys to achieving sustainable growth and development for developing countries especially in terms of health care service delivery. The availability and accessibility of Health information whenever it is needed is important in determining the effectiveness of healthcare service delivery. This brings about the need for information exchange between different health information systems with reference to the Nigerian health sector i.e. an integrated system of interoperable health information systems that can exchange data in a meaningful and coherent way. The need for standardization is identified as major factor in achieving integration and interoperability between any groups of heterogeneous systems that must function together. This research work employed the review of related literature and existing health information exchange systems to determine the strengths and flaws of existing health information exchange systems and architectural models. How they can be adapted to and used to improve the Nigerian healthcare system was also a subject matter in this study. Based on the federated model of health information exchange; an architectural model and Framework was designed to demonstrate how interoperability can be achieved. Architectural models and Frameworks were designed to suit Nigeria's unique healthcare structure while supporting the designed architectural models with the development of an API using the federated model of health information exchange. Data was transferred between health information systems in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format using the developed API. The study concluded that the development of health information exchange Standards that conform to existing health information exchange reference models by the collaboration of medical and Information technology bodies in Nigeria would allow for a nationally integrated and interoperable health care system.},

During the pandemic, new markets were created for public service provision in many fields, including but not limited to public health, and governments in the EU decreased regulatory controls on the private provision of public services. The results included increased government readiness to accept economic and political dependencies in return for efficiencies provided by large-scale infrastructures; decreased resistance among the general public to the private-sector takeover of what had been public tasks, and a corresponding lack of transparency about procurement and the alliances being made. We examine the features of these sector transgressions which make them difficult for civil society to resist, namely the instrumentalisation of privacy and data protection, the legalisation of transgressions through the decrease in regulatory controls, and the attractiveness to government of cheap and efficient infrastructural underpinnings to public services.},

We describe the experiences of the mothers in accessing and utilizing health services under the bundles, and the experiences of the health workers in providing the services. Between November and December 2022, we conducted a qualitative evaluation across health facilities in Kenya and Tanzania. We held Interviews with mothers (pregnant and postpartum women who had benefited from the care bundles) and health workers (physicians, nurses, and midwives who provided the care bundles, including health facility In-Charges) at the antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA), and postnatal care (PNC) service delivery points. We performed content analysis. Findings are reported using themes and quotes from the participants. We included 127 mothers (Kenya = 76, Tanzania = 51) and 119 health workers. Findings revealed that among mothers, the care bundles eased access to health services, ensured easy access and optimal ANC use, provision of respectful care, removed financial constraints, and led to the receipt of sufficient health education. Health workers reported that the care bundles offered them a new opportunity to provide quality maternal and newborn care and to adhere to the standard of care besides experiencing a positive and fulfilling practice. Health systems improvements included prompt emergency response and continual care, infrastructural developments, medical supplies and logistics, staffing, and increased documentation. Overall, the care bundles led to the strengthening of the healthcare system (staffing, service delivery, financing, supplies/logistics, and information management) in order to deliver quality maternal and child health services. The bundles should be replicated in settings with similar maternal and child health challenges.},

Research suggests that perceived data quality and lack of feedback are contributing factors. We aimed to understand maternity care providers' perceptions of data and how they use it, with a view to co-design interventions to improve data quality and use. Methods We based our research on constructivist grounded theory. We conducted 14 in-depth interviews, two focus group discussions with maternity care providers and 48 hours of observations in maternity wards to understand maternity providers' interaction with data in two rural hospitals in Southern Tanzania. Constant comparative data analysis was applied to develop initial and focused codes, subcategories and categories were continuously validated through peer and member checks. Results Maternity care providers found routine health information data of little use to reconcile demands from managers, the community and their challenging working environment within their daily work. They thus added informal narrative documentation sources. They created alternative narratives through data of a maternity care where mothers and babies were safeguarded. The resulting documentation system, however, led to duplication and increased systemic complexity. Conclusions Current health information systems may not meet all data demands of maternity care providers, or other healthcare workers. Policy makers and health information system specialists need to acknowledge different ways of data use beyond health service planning, with an emphasis on healthcare providers' data needs for clinical documentation.},

  abstract = {Objectives We evaluated the causal effects of high-risk versus low-risk pregnancy at the first antenatal care (ANC) visit on the occurrence of complications during pregnancy and labour or delivery among women in Kenya. Methods We designed a quasi-experimental study using observational data from a large mobile health wallet programme, with the exposure as pregnancy risk at the first ANC visit, measured on a binary scale (low vs high). Complications during pregnancy and at labour or delivery were the study outcomes on a binary scale (yes vs no). Causal effects of the exposure were examined using a double-robust estimation, reported as an OR with a 95\% CI. Results We studied 4419 women aged 10--49 years (mean, 25.6{\textpm}6.27 years), with the majority aged 20--29 years (53.4\%) and rural residents (87.4\%). Of 3271 women with low-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit, 833 (25.5\%) had complications during pregnancy while 1074 (32.8\%) had complications at labour/delivery. Conversely, of 1148 women with high-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit, 343 (29.9\%) had complication during pregnancy while 488 (42.5\%) had complications at labour delivery. Multivariable adjusted analysis showed that women with high-risk pregnancy at the time of first ANC attendance had a higher occurrence of pregnancy during pregnancy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.22, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.46) and labour or delivery (aOR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.41). In the double-robust estimation, a high-risk pregnancy at first ANC visit increased the occurrence of complications during pregnancy (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.46) and labour or delivery (OR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07 to 1.45). Conclusion Women with a high-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit have an increased occurrence of complications during pregnancy and labour or delivery. These women should be identified early for close and appropriate obstetric and intrapartum monitoring and care to ensure maternal and neonatal survival.},

To this end, I have proposed three fundamental business models - Distributor, Software producer [GPL and non-GPL] and the Third-Party Service Provider.  These are sustainable models that can lead to robust revenue streams.  The business models provided here can be enhanced by the addition of further revenue streams.  For instance, we now know that certification of developers on an Open-Source product can lead to strong revenues.  Not all products have the same profit potential.  Therefore, not all Open Source Software products have the same profit potential.  I have classified Open Source Software products into four categories - Stars, High-profile nichers, Low-profile nichers and Mainstream utilities.  Businesses can be built around Stars.  High-profile nichers can lead to robust revenue streams if properly marketed.  The other two categories may not lead to high profits.  Since many Open Source Software products are freely available, managers must scan public repositories to find out which products will be suitable for their business.  The future of Open Source Software is bright.  Increasingly, we will find that these products will take a central role in the realm of software and will find a larger place in all our lives.},

The open source innovation model has evolved to support a rapidly expanding ecosystem and body of practice supplanting traditional technology development, sales, marketing, and management practices. Open source is also increasingly sparking innovation and forming communities to tackle broad industry problems in diverse fields, including agriculture, public health, motion pictures, and telecommunications. Building on the foundational work of Henry Chesbrough, Eric von Hippel, and Yochai Benkler in Open Innovation, hobbyist technology innovation, and peer-based production, this chapter explores the rise to dominance of open source, the market disruption this emergence has created, and how open source is reshaping legacy business practices not only for early-stage innovation but also for later-stage innovation and collaboration, at scale.},

Its purpose is to assess the implementation factors, strengths and weaknesses of GoTHOMIS on healthcare services in Tanzania. The research employs a PAR methodology involving stakeholders from healthcare facilities, administrators, and I.T. experts. Data collection methods include document evaluation and interviews with key informants. The findings highlight significant areas for improvement in the implementation process, characterized by a top-down approach and a lack of user participation, hindering the system's successful adoption. Inadequate infrastructure, including network connectivity and outdated hardware, posed further challenges. Compatibility issues with peripheral devices and usability problems were also identified. Despite the challenges, GoTHOMIS demonstrated strengths such as improved accessibility, integration with the MTUHA reporting system, and automation of clinical tasks---weaknesses, including some system components, were only partially automated, which caused inefficiencies in the delivery of healthcare services and failure in integrating with other existing healthcare systems and data sources. Limitations of the study include a focus on selected healthcare facilities, limiting generalizability, and reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce biases. The study's originality lies in applying a PAR approach to assess GoTHOMIS, providing valuable insights into implementation challenges and potential improvements.},

  abstract = {Background: Years of health information system investment in many countries have facilitated service delivery, surveillance, reporting, and monitoring. Electricity, computing hardware, and internet networks are vital for health facility--based information systems. Availability of these infrastructures at health facilities is crucial for achieving national digital health visions. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the state of computing hardware, electricity, and connectivity infrastructure at health facilities in Sierra Leone using a representative sample. Methods: Stratified sampling of 72 (out of 1284) health facilities distributed in all districts of Sierra Leone was performed, factoring in the rural-urban divide, digital health activity, health facility type, and health facility ownership. Enumerators visited each health facility over a 2-week period. Results: Among the 72 surveyed health facilities, 59 (82\%) do not have institutionally provided internet. Among the 15 Maternal and Child Health Posts, as a type of primary health care unit (PHU), 9 (60\%) use solar energy as their only electricity source and the other 6 (40\%) have no electricity source. Similarly, among the 13 hospitals, 5 (38\%) use a generator as a primary electricity source. All hospitals have at least one functional computer, although only 7 of the 13 hospitals have four or more functional computers. Similarly, only 2 of the 59 (3\%) PHUs have one computer each, and 37 (63\%) of the PHUs have one tablet device each. We consider this health care computing infrastructure mapping to be representative with a 95\% confidence level within an 11\% margin of error. Two-thirds of the PHUs have only alternate solar electricity, only 10 of the 72 surveyed health facilities have functional official internet, and most use suboptimal computing hardware. Overall, 43\% of the surveyed health facilities believe that inadequate electricity is the biggest threat to digitization. Similarly, 16 (22\%) of the 72 respondents stated that device theft is a primary hindrance to digitization. Conclusions: Electricity provision for off-electricity-grid health facilities using alternative and renewable energy sources is emerging. The current trend where GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) service providers provide the internet to all health facilities may change to other promising alternatives. This study provides evidence of the critical infrastructure gaps in health facilities in Sierra Leone.},

  abstract = {Healthcare data sharing is vital to the future of patient-centred care. However, it is challenged by weaknesses inherent in the communication infrastructure that support such data sharing. A key challenge has been pinned on the poor standardisation of digital health systems that make up the communication infrastructure thereby affecting the collection, processing, storage and transmission of health data/client's electronic medical records. This chapter presents experiences from Uganda regards progress in standardisation. A scoping literature review informed conceptualisation of digital health standardisation to involve setting standards context, standards development process, and implementation plus compliance monitoring. These three constructs guided the exploration of Uganda's state of digital health standardisation, conducted in four regions of the country. Whereas qualitative data collected were analysed using a thematic approach, the quantitative data was statistically analysed. Findings showed unstandardised implementations of digital health devices and applications, disparate and intermittent network connectivity with poor quality of service, limited digital health use skills, and inadequate facilitating resources. Further exploration attributed these limitations to weaknesses in the standardisation process and a lack of contextual standards to guide digital health implementations. Further works will develop a framework for fast-tracking the standardisation of the digital health communication infrastructure in low-resource health systems like Uganda.},

  abstract = {Background To receive the best care, people share their health data (HD) with their health practitioners (known as sharing HD for primary purposes). However, during the past two decades, sharing for other (i.e., secondary) purposes has become of great importance in numerous fields, including public health, personalized medicine, research, and development. We aimed to conduct the first comprehensive overview of all studies that investigated people's HD sharing attitudes---along with associated barriers/motivators and significant influencing factors---for all data types and across both primary and secondary uses. Methods We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CINAHL for relevant studies published in English between database inception and February 28, 2023, using a predefined set of keywords. Studies were included, regardless of their design, if they reported outcomes related to attitudes towards sharing HD. We extracted key data from the included studies, including the type of HD involved and findings related to: HD sharing attitudes (either in general or depending on type of data/user); barriers/motivators/benefits/concerns of the study participants; and sociodemographic and other variables that could impact HD sharing behaviour. The qualitative synthesis was conducted by dividing the studies according to the data type (resulting in five subgroups) as well as the purpose the data sharing was focused on (primary, secondary or both). The Newcastle--Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of non-randomised studies. This work was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023413822. Findings Of 2109 studies identified through our search, 116 were included in the qualitative synthesis, yielding a total of 228,501 participants and various types of HD represented: person-generated HD (n~=~17 studies and 10,771 participants), personal HD in general (n~=~69 studies and 117,054 participants), Biobank data (n~=~7 studies and 27,073 participants), genomic data (n~=~13 studies and 54,716 participants), and miscellaneous data (n~=~10 studies and 18,887 participants). The majority of studies had a moderate level of quality (83 [71.6\%] of 116 studies), but varying levels of quality were observed across the included studies. Overall, studies suggest that sharing intentions for primary purposes were observed to be high regardless of data type, and it was higher than sharing intentions for secondary purposes. Sharing for secondary purposes yielded variable findings, where both the highest and the lowest intention rates were observed in the case of studies that explored sharing biobank data (98\% and 10\%, respectively). Several influencing factors on sharing intentions were identified, such as the type of data recipient, data, consent. Further, concerns related to data sharing that were found to be mutual for all data types included privacy, security, and data access/control, while the perceived benefits included those related to improvements in healthcare. Findings regarding attitudes towards sharing varied significantly across sociodemographic factors and depended on data type and type of use. In most cases, these findings were derived from single studies and therefore warrant confirmations from additional studies. Interpretation Sharing health data is a complex issue that is influenced by various factors (the type of health data, the intended use, the data recipient, among others) and these insights could be used to overcome barriers, address people's concerns, and focus on spreading awareness about the data sharing process and benefits. Funding None.},

  abstract = {Background: eHealth increasingly affects the delivery of health care around the world and the quest for more efficient health systems. In Finland, the development of eHealth maturity has been systematically studied since 2003, through surveys conducted every 3 years. It has also been monitored in several international studies. The indicators used in these studies examined the availability of the electronic patient record, picture archiving and communication system, health information exchange, and other key eHealth functionalities. Objective: The first aim is to study the national development in the maturity level of eHealth in primary health care and specialized care between 2011 and 2020 in Finland. The second aim is to clarify the regional differences in the maturity level of eHealth among Finnish hospital districts in 2020. Methods: Data for this study were collected in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, using web-based questionnaires from the Use of information and communication technology surveys in Finnish health care project. In total, 16 indicators were selected to describe the status of eHealth, and they were based on international eHealth studies and Finnish eHealth surveys in 3 areas: applications, regional integration, and data security and information and communications technology skills. The indicators remain the same in all the study years; therefore, the results are comparable. Results: All the specialized care organizations (21/21, 100\%) in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 participated in the study. The response rate among primary health care organizations was 86.3\% (139/161) in 2011, 88.2\% (135/153) in 2014, 85.8\% (121/141) in 2017, and 95.6\% (130/136) in 2020. At the national level, the biggest developments in eHealth maturity occurred between 2011 and 2014. The development has since continued, and some indicators have been saturated. Primary health care lags behind specialized care organizations, as measured by all the indicators and throughout the period under review. Regionally, there are differences among different types of organizations. Conclusions: eHealth maturity has steadily progressed in Finland nationally, and its implementation has also been promoted through various national strategies and legislative changes. Some eHealth indicators have already been saturated and achieved an intensity of use rate of 100\%. However, the scope for development remains, especially in primary health care. As Finland has long been a pioneer in the digitalization of health care, the results of this study show that the functionalities of eHealth will be adopted in stages, and deployment will take time; therefore, national eHealth strategies and legislative changes need to be implemented in a timely manner. The comprehensive sample size used in this study allows a regional comparison in the country, compared with previous country-specific international studies.},

Objective: To systematically review the available research on HIE outcomes and analyze future research needs. Methods: Data sources included citations from selected databases from January 1990 to February 2015. We included English-language studies of HIE in clinical or public health settings in any country. Data were extracted using dual review with adjudication of disagreements. Results: We identified 34 studies on outcomes of HIE. No studies reported on clinical outcomes (eg, mortality and morbidity) or identified harms. Low-quality evidence generally finds that HIE reduces duplicative laboratory and radiology testing, emergency department costs, hospital admissions (less so for readmissions), and improves public health reporting, ambulatory quality of care, and disability claims processing. Most clinicians attributed positive changes in care coordination, communication, and knowledge about patients to HIE. Conclusions: Although the evidence supports benefits of HIE in reducing the use of specific resources and improving the quality of care, the full impact of HIE on clinical outcomes and potential harms are inadequately studied. Future studies must address comprehensive questions, use more rigorous designs, and employ a standard for describing types of HIE.

Objective{$\quad$}We describe the Nigeria NDR and its development process, including its use for surveillance, research, and national HIV program monitoring toward achieving HIV epidemic control.             Methods{$\quad$}Stakeholder engagement meetings were held in 2013 to gather information on data elements and vocabulary standards for reporting patient-level information, technical infrastructure, human capacity requirements, and information flow. Findings from these meetings guided the development of the NDR. An implementation guide provided common terminologies and data reporting structures for data exchange between the NDR and the electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Data from the EMR were encoded in extensible markup language and sent to the NDR over secure hypertext transfer protocol after going through a series of validation processes.             Results{$\quad$}By June 30, 2021, the NDR had up-to-date records of 1,477,064 (94.4\%) patients receiving HIV treatment across 1,985 health facilities, of which 1,266,512 (85.7\%) patient records had fingerprint template data to support unique patient identification and record linkage to prevent registration of the same patient under different identities. Data from the NDR was used to support HIV program monitoring, case-based surveillance and production of products like the monthly lists of patients who have treatment interruptions and dashboards for monitoring HIV test and start.             Conclusion{$\quad$}The NDR enabled the availability of reliable and timely data for surveillance, research, and HIV program monitoring to guide program improvements to accelerate progress toward epidemic control.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} The use of digital technology in healthcare promises to improve quality of care and reduce costs over time. This promise will be difficult to attain without interoperability: facilitating seamless health information exchange between the deployed digital health information systems (HIS). Objective{\enspace} To determine the maturity readiness of the interoperability capacity of Kenya's HIS. Methods{\enspace} We used the HIS Interoperability Maturity Toolkit, developed by MEASURE Evaluation and the Health Data Collaborative's Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group. The assessment was undertaken by eHealth stakeholder representatives primarily from the Ministry of Health's Digital Health Technical Working Group. The toolkit focused on three major domains: leadership and governance, human resources and technology. Results{\enspace} Most domains are at the lowest two levels of maturity: nascent or emerging. At the nascent level, HIS activities happen by chance or represent isolated, ad hoc efforts. An emerging maturity level characterises a system with defined HIS processes and structures. However, such processes are not systematically documented and lack ongoing monitoring mechanisms. Conclusion{\enspace} None of the domains had a maturity level greater than level 2 (emerging). The subdomains of governance structures for HIS, defined national enterprise architecture for HIS, defined technical standards for data exchange, nationwide communication network infrastructure, and capacity for operations and maintenance of hardware attained higher maturity levels. These findings are similar to those from interoperability maturity assessments done in Ghana and Uganda.},

  abstract = {Recently, significant milestones have been achieved in the field of healthcare data analysis. However, alongside these accomplishments, substantial data-related challenges have emerged in the domain of big data management. Modern healthcare projects are no more dealing with a single data repository but many heterogeneous ones and must overcome data variety, privacy and governance issues. Yet, current solutions face a privacy-decentralization trade-off. To address this dual challenge, we introduce HealthMesh, a novel layered architectural framework based on the Data Mesh principles, providing a domaindecentralised paradigm. In addition, the framework incorporates a Semantic Data Model which establishes robust governance, enables interoperability and guarantees policy compliance for all the data assets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, we provide an illustrative example inspired by the use case of the INCISIVE project for breast cancer analytics. Overall, this work makes a significant contribution on collecting key challenges, identifying actors and providing a set of components and guidelines for establishing a holistic framework for the complex field of healthcare data management.},

  abstract = {For most large enterprises today, data constitutes their core asset, along with code and infrastructure. For most enterprises, the amount of data that they produce internally has exploded in recent years. At the same time, in many cases, engineers and data scientists do not use centralized data-management systems and end up creating what became known as a data lake---a collection of datasets that often are not well organized or not organized at all and where one needs to ``fish'' for useful datasets. In this paper, we describe our experience building and deploying GOODS, a system to manage Google's internal data lake. GOODS crawls Google's infrastructure and builds a catalog of discovered datasets, including structured files, databases, spreadsheets, and even services that provide access to the data. GOODS extracts metadata about datasets in a post-hoc way: engineers continue to generate and organize datasets in the same way that they have before, and GOODS provides value without disrupting teams' practices. The technical challenges that we had to address resulted both from the scale and heterogeneity of Google's data lake and from our decision to extract metadata in a post-hoc manner. We believe that many of the lessons that we learned are applicable to building large-scale enterprise-level data-management systems in general.},

  abstract = {Efficient big data management is a dire necessity to manage the exponential growth in data generated by digital information systems to produce usable knowledge. Structured databases, data lakes, and warehouses have each provided a solution with varying degrees of success. However, a new and superior solution, the data Lakehouse, has emerged to extract actionable insights from unstructured data ingested from distributed sources. By combining the strengths of data warehouses and data lakes, the data Lakehouse can process and merge data quickly while ingesting and storing high-speed unstructured data with post-storage transformation and analytics capabilities. The Lakehouse architecture offers the necessary features for optimal functionality and has gained significant attention in the big data management research community. In this paper, we compare data lake, warehouse, and lakehouse systems, highlight their strengths and shortcomings, identify the desired features to handle the evolving challenges in big data management and analysis and propose an advanced data Lakehouse architecture. We also demonstrate the performance of three state-of-the-art data management systems namely HDFS data lake, Hive data warehouse, and Delta lakehouse in managing data for analytical query responses through an experimental study.},

One way to prevent data lakes from turning into inoperable data swamps is semantic data management. Some approaches propose the linkage of metadata to knowledge graphs based on the Linked Data principles to provide more meaning and semantics to the data in the lake. Such a semantic layer may be utilized not only for data management but also to tackle the problem of data integration from heterogeneous sources, in order to make data access more expressive and interoperable. In this survey, we review recent approaches with a specific focus on the application within data lake systems and scalability to Big Data. We classify the approaches into (i) basic semantic data management, (ii) semantic modeling approaches for enriching metadata in data lakes, and (iii) methods for ontologybased data access. In each category, we cover the main techniques and their background, and compare latest research. Finally, we point out challenges for future work in this research area, which needs a closer integration of Big Data and Semantic Web technologies.},

In fact, extracting insights from data is so common in daily life of individuals, companies, and public entities and so relevant for the market players, to become an important matter of interest for institutional organizations. The theme is so relevant that ad hoc regulations have been proposed. One important aspect is given by the capability of the applications to tackle the data privacy issue. Additionally, depending on the specific application field, paramount importance is given to the possibility for the humans to understand why a certain AI/ML-based application is providing that specific output. In this paper, we discuss the concept of Federated Learning of eXplainable AI (XAI) models, in short FED-XAI, purposely designed to address these two requirements simultaneously. AI/ML models are trained with the simultaneous goals of preserving the data privacy (Federated Learning (FL) side) and ensuring a certain level of explainability of the system (XAI side). We first introduce the motivations at the foundation of FL and XAI, along with their basic concepts; then, we discuss the current status of this field of study, providing a brief survey regarding approaches, models, and results. Finally, we highlight the main future challenges.},

As each of these systems` workloads has contradictory different needs, managing a multipurpose electronic health record is a challenge. This paper proposes a unified healthcare data framework that can simplify health information system infrastructure. It investigates the suitability of the documentbased NoSQL persistence mechanism, storing electronic health records data as a design choice for managing varied complexity ad hoc queries used in operational business intelligence. The performance of the most popular two document-based NoSQL back-ends, Couchbase Server and MongoDB, is compared according to the size of the database and query execution time. Results showed that while MongoDB can execute simple singledocument queries nearly in milliseconds. It does not provide satisfactory response time for unplanned complex queries spanning multiple documents. By utilizing its analytics services and multi-dimensional scaling architecture, Couchbase Server multi-node cluster outperforms the response times of MongoDB for both simple and complex healthcare data access patterns. The primary advantage of the proposed tightly coupled EHRs processing framework is its flexibility to manage workload according to changing requirements.},

The recent, increasing adoption of a common standard, i.e., the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), makes it easier to exchange medical data among the several parties involved, for example, in an epidemiological research activity. However, this exchange process is hindered by regulatory frameworks due to privacy issues related to the presence of personal information, which allows patients to be identified directly (or indirectly) from their medical data. When properly used, de-identification techniques can provide crucial support in overcoming these problems. FHIR-DIET aims to bring flexibility and concreteness to the implementation of de-identification of health data, supporting many customised data-processing behaviours that can be easily configured and tailored to match specific use case requirements. Our solution enables faster and easier cooperation between legal and IT professionals to establish and implement de-identification rules. The performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of processing hundreds of FHIR patient information data per second using standard hardware. We believe FHIR-DIET can be a valuable tool to satisfy the current regulation requirements and help to create added-value for the secondary use of healthcare data.},

To solve this problem, it is necessary to proceed from the results of the assessment according to several criteria. In turn, experimental evaluation does not always give a complete understanding of the possibilities for working with a particular data storage format.

Displaced populations have unique acute and chronic health needs that must be met by low-resource health systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been shown to improve health outcomes in displaced populations, but need to be adapted to meet the constraints of these health systems. Objective: The aim of this viewpoint is to describe the development and deployment of an EHR designed to care for displaced populations in low-resource settings. Methods: Using a human-centered design approach, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients, health care providers, and administrators in Lebanon and Jordan to identify the essential EHR features. These features, including modular workflows, multilingual interfaces, and offline-first capabilities, led to the development of the Hikma Health EHR, which has been deployed in Lebanon and Nicaragua. Results: We report the successes and challenges from 12 months of Hikma Health EHR deployment in a mobile clinic providing care to Syrian refugees in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Successes include the EHR's ability to (1) increase clinical efficacy by providing detailed patient records, (2) be adaptable to the threats of COVID-19, and (3) improve organizational planning. Lessons learned include technical fixes to methods of identifying patients through name or their medical record ID. Conclusions: As the number of displaced people continues to rise globally, it is imperative that solutions are created to help maximize the health care they receive. Free, open-sourced, and adaptable EHRs can enable organizations to better provide for displaced populations.},

Despite the success of many of these so-called ``deliverables'', the establishment of a single nationwide electronic health record (EHR) system never fully materialised. Healthcare practitioners are all too often left without access to large sections of their patients' medical records due to their being recording on any one of a plethora of alternative EHR systems. This not only limits their ability to make well-informed clinical decisions, but also the quality of care they are able to provide. This article evaluates the medical, economic and bureaucratic implications of an NHS-wide EHR system before exploring how the shortcomings of the NPfIT should be addressed when attempting to introduce such a system in future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Accessible and affordable health services and products including medicines, vaccines, and public health are an important health agenda of all countries. It is well understood that without digital health technologies, countries will face difficulties in tackling the needs and demands of their population. Global agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations (UN), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), etc. have been instrumental in providing various tools, and guidance through digital health strategies in improving health and digital health maturity of the countries. The Digital Health Platform Handbook (DHPH) is a toolkit published by WHO and ITU to help countries create and implement a digital health platform (DHP) to serve as the underlying infrastructure for an interoperable and integrated national digital health system. We apply the foundational principles of DHPH and provide a perspective of DHP components in a layered, enterprise architecture of a digital health infrastructure. India has rolled out the blueprint of its National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) to address the emerging needs for digitization of healthcare in the country. In this paper, we also illustrate the design and implementation of WHO-ITU DHP components at the national level by exploring India's digital health mission implementation utilizing various digital public goods to build a digital health ecosystem in the country.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product "architecture," define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.},

But platforms and the systems in which they are embedded are very diverse. In particular, platforms may exist within firms as product lines, across firms as multi-product systems, and in the form of multi-sided markets. In this paper we argue that there is a fundamental unity in the architecture of platforms. Platform architectures are modularizations of complex systems in which certain components (the platform itself) remain stable, while others (the complements) are encouraged to vary in crosssection or over time. Among the most stable elements in a platform architecture are the modular interfaces that mediate between the platform and its complements. These interfaces are even more stable than the interior core of the platform, thus control over the interfaces amounts to control over the platform and its evolution. We describe three ways of representing platform architectures: network graphs, design structure matrices and layer maps. We conclude by addressing a number of fundamental strategic questions suggested by a unified view of platforms.},

We addressed these issues by building a theoretical framework based on three concepts: Feature Importance, Counterexample Explanations, and Similar-Case Explanations. Grounded in the literature, the model was deployed within a case study in which, using a participatory design approach, we designed and developed a high-fidelity prototype. Through the co-design and development of the prototype and the underlying model, we advanced the knowledge on how to design AI-based systems for enabling complementarity in the decision-making process in the healthcare domain.

  abstract = {Knowledge sharing is increasingly being recognized as necessary to address societal, economic, environmental, and public health challenges. This often requires collaboration between federal, local, and tribal governments along with the private sector, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education. To achieve this, there needs to be a move away from data-centric to knowledge sharing architectures, such as a Geospatial Knowledge Infrastructure (GKI). Data from multiple organizations need to be properly contextualized in both space and time to support geographically based planning, decision making, cooperation and coordination. A spatial knowledge graph (SKG) is a useful paradigm for facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration. However, interoperability between independently developed SKGs from different organizations that reference the same geographies is often not automated in a machine-readable way due to a lack of standardization. This paper outlines an architecture that automates interoperability and dependency management between SKGs as they are formally published by version and period of validity. We are calling this approach a spatial knowledge mesh (SKM), as it is a specialization of the data mesh architecture along with the concept of a common geo-registry to facilitate knowledge sharing more easily. The initial implementation, called GeoPrism Registry, is being developed as an open-source spatial knowledge infrastructure as a platform to help countries meet their NSDI and GKI objectives. It was fist funded and deployed to support ministries of health and is more recently being utilized in GeoPlatform.gov.},

Unfortunately, academic discourse on digital transformation has largely left SDT unaccounted for. Drawing on more than 25 years of intensive, interventionist research engagement with the digital transformation of public healthcare information management and delivery in more than 80 countries in the Global South, we contribute to theorizing SDT in the form of a design theory consisting of six interconnected design principles. These design principles articulate the interplay and tensions of accommodating over time increased diversity and flexibility in digital solutions, while simultaneously connecting local, national, and regional/ global efforts.},

However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.},

  abstract = {During public health crises, the significance of rapid data sharing cannot be overstated. In attempts to accelerate COVID-19 pandemic responses, discussions within society and scholarly research have focused on data sharing among health care providers, across government departments at different levels, and on an international scale. A lesser-addressed yet equally important approach to sharing data during the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises involves cross-sector collaboration between government entities and academic researchers. Specifically, this refers to dedicated projects in which a government entity shares public health data with an academic research team for data analysis to receive data insights to inform policy. In this viewpoint, we identify and outline documented data sharing challenges in the context of COVID-19 and other public health crises, as well as broader crisis scenarios encompassing natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies. We then argue that government-academic data collaborations have the potential to alleviate these challenges, which should place them at the forefront of future research attention. In particular, for researchers, data collaborations with government entities should be considered part of the social infrastructure that bolsters their research efforts toward public health crisis response. Looking ahead, we propose a shift from ad hoc, intermittent collaborations to cultivating robust and enduring partnerships. Thus, we need to move beyond viewing government-academic data interactions as 1-time sharing events. Additionally, given the scarcity of scholarly exploration in this domain, we advocate for further investigation into the real-world practices and experiences related to sharing data from government sources with researchers during public health crises.},

Current literature focuses on the evaluation of health interventions using EDC but does not provide an in-depth description of the systems used or how they are developed. In this viewpoint, we present case descriptions from 2 low- and middle-income countries: Ethiopia and Myanmar. We address a gap in evidence by describing each EDC system in detail and discussing the pros and cons of different approaches. We then present common lessons learned from the 2 case descriptions as recommendations for considerations in developing and implementing EDC in low-resource settings, using a sociotechnical framework for studying health information technology in complex adaptive health care systems. Our recommendations highlight the importance of selecting hardware compatible with local infrastructure, using flexible software systems that facilitate communication across different languages and levels of literacy, and conducting iterative, participatory design with individuals with deep knowledge of local clinical and cultural norms.},

  abstract = {Background: Investigating low-prevalence diseases such as multiple sclerosis is challenging because of the rather small number of individuals affected by this disease and the scattering of real-world data across numerous data sources. These obstacles impair data integration, standardization, and analysis, which negatively impact the generation of significant meaningful clinical evidence. Objective: This study aims to present a comprehensive, research question--agnostic, multistakeholder-driven end-to-end data analysis pipeline that accommodates 3 prevalent data-sharing streams: individual data sharing, core data set sharing, and federated model sharing. Methods: A demand-driven methodology is employed for standardization, followed by 3 streams of data acquisition, a data quality enhancement process, a data integration procedure, and a concluding analysis stage to fulfill real-world data-sharing requirements. This pipeline's effectiveness was demonstrated through its successful implementation in the COVID-19 and multiple sclerosis global data sharing initiative. Results: The global data sharing initiative yielded multiple scientific publications and provided extensive worldwide guidance for the community with multiple sclerosis. The pipeline facilitated gathering pertinent data from various sources, accommodating distinct sharing streams and assimilating them into a unified data set for subsequent statistical analysis or secure data examination. This pipeline contributed to the assembly of the largest data set of people with multiple sclerosis infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: The proposed data analysis pipeline exemplifies the potential of global stakeholder collaboration and underlines the significance of evidence-based decision-making. It serves as a paradigm for how data sharing initiatives can propel advancements in health care, emphasizing its adaptability and capacity to address diverse research inquiries.},

  abstract = {Background and objective As a response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several prediction models in the existing literature were rapidly developed, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidance. However, none of these COVID-19 prediction models have been found to be reliable. Models are commonly assessed to have a risk of bias, often due to insufficient reporting, use of non-representative data, and lack of large-scale external validation. In this paper, we present the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modeling as a standardized approach for rapid yet reliable development and validation of prediction models. We demonstrate how our analytics pipeline and open-source software tools can be used to answer important prediction questions while limiting potential causes of bias (e.g., by validating phenotypes, specifying the target population, performing large-scale external validation, and publicly providing all analytical source code). Methods We show step-by-step how to implement the analytics pipeline for the question: `In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, what is the risk of death 0 to 30 days after hospitalization?'. We develop models using six different machine learning methods in a USA claims database containing over 20,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and externally validate the models using data containing over 45,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations from South Korea, Spain, and the USA. Results Our open-source software tools enabled us to efficiently go end-to-end from problem design to reliable Model Development and evaluation. When predicting death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, AdaBoost, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree yielded similar or lower internal and external validation discrimination performance compared to L1-regularized logistic regression, whereas the MLP neural network consistently resulted in lower discrimination. L1-regularized logistic regression models were well calibrated. Conclusion Our results show that following the OHDSI analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modelling can enable the rapid development towards reliable prediction models. The OHDSI software tools and pipeline are open source and available to researchers from all around the world.},

  abstract = {Increasing availability of electronic health databases capturing real-world experiences with medical products has garnered much interest in their use for pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. The traditional practice of having numerous groups use single databases to accomplish similar tasks and address common questions about medical products can be made more efficient through well-coordinated multi-database studies, greatly facilitated through distributed data network (DDN) architectures. Access to larger amounts of electronic health data within DDNs has created a growing interest in using data-adaptive machine learning (ML) techniques that can automatically model complex associations in high-dimensional data with minimal human guidance. However, the siloed storage and diverse nature of the databases in DDNs create unique challenges for using ML. In this paper, we discuss opportunities, challenges, and considerations for applying ML in DDNs for pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. We first discuss major types of activities performed by DDNs and how ML may be used. Next, we discuss practical data-related factors influencing how DDNs work in practice. We then combine these discussions and jointly consider how opportunities for ML are affected by practical data-related factors for DDNs, leading to several challenges. We present different approaches for addressing these challenges and highlight efforts that real-world DDNs have taken or are currently taking to help mitigate them. Despite these challenges, the time is ripe for the emerging interest to use ML in DDNs, and the utility of these data-adaptive modeling techniques in pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies will likely continue to increase in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Background and objective To take full advantage of decision support, machine learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important that models are not only created, but also deployed in a clinical setting. The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. Methods The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. Results We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. Conclusion The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR).},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of computer software and hardware technologies, more and more healthcare data are becoming readily available from clinical institutions, patients, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical industries, among others. This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, ``big data.'' Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Background: In a multisite clinical research collaboration, institutions may or may not use the same common data model (CDM) to store clinical data. To overcome this challenge, we proposed to use Health Level 7's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a meta-CDM---a single standard to represent clinical data. Objective: In this study, we aimed to create an open-source application termed the Clinical Asset Mapping Program for FHIR (CAMP FHIR) to efficiently transform clinical data to FHIR for supporting source-agnostic CDM-to-FHIR mapping. Methods: Mapping with CAMP FHIR involves (1) mapping each source variable to its corresponding FHIR element and (2) mapping each item in the source data's value sets to the corresponding FHIR value set item for variables with strict value sets. To date, CAMP FHIR has been used to transform 108 variables from the Informatics for Integrating Biology \&amp; the Bedside (i2b2) and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network data models to fields across 7 FHIR resources. It is designed to allow input from any source data model and will support additional FHIR resources in the future. Results: We have used CAMP FHIR to transform data on approximately 23,000 patients with asthma from our institution's i2b2 database. Data quality and integrity were validated against the origin point of the data, our enterprise clinical data warehouse. Conclusions: We believe that CAMP FHIR can serve as an alternative to implementing new CDMs on a project-by-project basis. Moreover, the use of FHIR as a CDM could support rare data sharing opportunities, such as collaborations between academic medical centers and community hospitals. We anticipate adoption and use of CAMP FHIR to foster sharing of clinical data across institutions for downstream applications in translational research.},

  abstract = {Background: The harmonization and standardization of digital medical information for research purposes is a challenging and ongoing collaborative effort. Current research data repositories typically require extensive efforts in harmonizing and transforming original clinical data. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format was designed primarily to represent clinical processes; therefore, it closely resembles the clinical data model and is more widely available across modern electronic health records. However, no common standardized data format is directly suitable for statistical analyses, and data need to be preprocessed before statistical analysis. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate how FHIR data can be queried directly with a preprocessing service and be used for statistical analyses. Methods: We propose that the binary JavaScript Object Notation format of the PostgreSQL (PSQL) open source database is suitable for not only storing FHIR data, but also extending it with preprocessing and filtering services, which directly transform data stored in FHIR format into prepared data subsets for statistical analysis. We specified an interface for this preprocessor, implemented and deployed it at University Hospital Erlangen-N{\"u}rnberg, generated 3 sample data sets, and analyzed the available data. Results: We imported real-world patient data from 2016 to 2018 into a standard PSQL database, generating a dataset of approximately 35.5 million FHIR resources, including ``Patient,'' ``Encounter,'' ``Condition'' (diagnoses specified using International Classification of Diseases codes), ``Procedure,'' and ``Observation'' (laboratory test results). We then integrated the developed preprocessing service with the PSQL database and the locally installed web-based KETOS analysis platform. Advanced statistical analyses were feasible using the developed framework using 3 clinically relevant scenarios (data-driven establishment of hemoglobin reference intervals, assessment of anemia prevalence in patients with cancer, and investigation of the adverse effects of drugs). Conclusions: This study shows how the standard open source database PSQL can be used to store FHIR data and be integrated with a specifically developed preprocessing and analysis framework. This enables dataset generation with advanced medical criteria and the integration of subsequent statistical analysis. The web-based preprocessing service can be deployed locally at the hospital level, protecting patients' privacy while being integrated with existing open source data analysis tools currently being developed across Germany.},

  abstract = {Background: An essential step in any medical research project after identifying the research question is to determine if there are sufficient patients available for a study and where to find them. Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing. Objective: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data. Methods: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service. Results: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative. Conclusions: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.},

This paper develops business model archetypes for the full array of data marketplace types, ranging from private to independent ownership and from a hierarchical to a market orientation. Through exploratory interviews and case analyses, we create a business model taxonomy. Patterns in our taxonomy reveal four business model archetypes. We find that privately-owned data marketplaces with hierarchical orientation apply the aggregating data marketplace archetype. Consortium-owned data marketplaces apply the archetypes of aggregating data marketplace with additional brokering service and consulting data marketplace. Independently owned data marketplaces with market orientation apply the facilitating data marketplace archetype. Our results provide a basis for configurational theory that explains the performance of data marketplace business models. Our results also provide a basis for specifying boundary conditions for theory on data marketplace business models, as, for instance, the importance of network effects differs strongly between the archetypes.},

The lack of enabling guidelines and standards across the continent, on the other hand, makes it difficult to share data in a meaningful way across the continent. Considering this, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) established a task force of 24 members to provide expertise and guidance in the development of AU HIE guidelines and standards. Members of the task force were subject matter experts working in Africa and internationally on the collection, analysis, and exchange of health information. Some of these experts had been involved in previous consultations on defining Africa CDC's health information systems strategy. A chairperson, co-chairperson, and secretary were elected to engage the task force members in different technical working groups. The technical leadership and coordination of this work was done by the University of Gondar and HISP SA. A chairperson, co-chairperson, and secretary were elected to engage the task force members. Three technical working groups were constituted to lead the drafting of the three sections of the document: 1. HIE Policy directions 2. HIE Standards 3. Implementation Use Cases Following several virtual meetings and consultations, a draft document on AU HIE guidelines and standards was developed. The methodology employed involved the reviewing of scientific publications and governmental reports on HIE guidelines and standards in Africa; reviewing Internationally known comprehensive and robust data exchange standards; and incorporating recommendations from the Africa CDC HIE Task Force Members. Additionally, the document was critically reviewed and validated by Member States in all AU regions through several validation workshops; West Africa (validation workshop took place in Senegal), Central Africa (Congo-Brazaville), East Africa (Rwanda), South Africa (Namibia) and North Africa (Mauritania) through validation workshops.

  abstract = {Background Health facilities in developing countries are increasingly adopting Electronic Health Records systems (EHRs) to support healthcare processes. However, only limited studies are available that assess the actual use of the EHRs once adopted in these settings. We assessed the state of the 376 KenyaEMR system (national EHRs) implementations in healthcare facilities offering HIV services in Kenya. Methods The study focused on seven EHRs use indicators. Six of the seven indicators were programmed and packaged into a query script for execution within each KenyaEMR system (KeEMRs) implementation to collect monthly server-log data for each indicator for the period 2012--2019. The indicators included: Staff system use, observations (clinical data volume), data exchange, standardized terminologies, patient identification, and automatic reports. The seventh indicator (EHR variable Completeness) was derived from routine data quality report within the EHRs. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine how individual facility characteristics affected the use of the system. Results 213 facilities spanning 19 counties participated in the study. The mean number of authorized users who actively used the KeEMRs was 18.1\% (SD = 13.1\%, p{$<$}0.001) across the facilities. On average, the volume of clinical data (observations) captured in the EHRs was 3363 (SD = 4259). Only a few facilities(14.1\%) had health data exchange capability. 97.6\% of EHRs concept dictionary terms mapped to standardized terminologies such as CIEL. Within the facility EHRs, only 50.5\% (SD = 35.4\%, p{$<$} 0.001) of patients had the nationally-endorsed patient identifier number recorded. Multiple regression analysis indicated the need for improvement on the mode of EHRs use of implementation. Conclusion The standard EHRs use indicators can effectively measure EHRs use and consequently determine success of the EHRs implementations. The results suggest that most of the EHRs use areas assessed need improvement, especially in relation to active usage of the system and data exchange readiness.},

These open storage systems with rich management features promise to simplify management of large datasets, accelerate SQL workloads, and offer fast, direct file access for other workloads, such as machine learning. However, the research community has not explored the tradeoffs in designing lakehouse systems in detail. In this paper, we analyze the designs of the three most popular lakehouse storage systems---Delta Lake, Hudi and Iceberg---and compare their performance and features among varying axes based on these designs. We also release a simple benchmark, LHBench, that researchers can use to compare other designs. LHBench is available at https://github.com/lhbench/lhbench.},

In order to establish interoperability with the other German Consortia belonging to the same national initiative, we mapped the openEHR information to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format recommended within the initiative. FHIR enables fast exchange of data thanks to the discrete and independent data elements into which information is organized. Furthermore, to explore the possibility of maximizing analysis capabilities for our data set, we subsequently mapped the FHIR elements to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). The OMOP data model is designed to support the conduct of research to identify and evaluate associations between interventions and outcomes caused by these interventions. Mapping across standard allows to exploit their peculiarities while establishing and/or maintaining interoperability.

Communicable and non-communicable diseases are increasing at an alarming rate and straining already overburdened and weak heath systems. Faced with a rapidly growing population, poorly equipped health workforce and meager resources to support the healthcare systems, there is a continuous search for tools to offer better healthcare in these resource constrained settings. ICT for development is one tool that has been adopted to improve access to quality healthcare for populations in resource constrained settings. While the tool has been shown to impact the health care sector positively, the use of ICT has brought in challenges of interoperability and usability of electronic systems in health. In this paper we investigate how Kenya has utilized ICT to spur development in the health sector and the measures she is undertaking to address these challenges. We advance that ICT for development is a tool that needs to be fully exploited by developing countries in order to bridge gaps in healthcare emanating from limited finances, poor infrastructure and an overstretched healthcare workforce.},

First, use of open standards and architectures that separate standard business logic from supporting applications will allow government to become technology- and vendor-agnostic, freeing it from its overdependence on proprietary systems and suppliers. Second, over time, open standards and increased market choice will drive both innovation and progressive convergence on cheaper, standard ``utility'' public services. These two features will combine to create a powerful dynamic situation, driving disintegration of traditional ``black boxed'' technologies and services, traditionally organized around ``systems integrators'' and departmental structures, and their reaggregation around the citizen in the form of services. Such reaggregation is allowing progressively sharp distinctions between niche/innovative and commodity/standard offerings, supplied by a plural, innovative, and more cost-effective marketplace, with unprecedented implications for the way in which the state buys and deploys technology. We draw on a range of data from across public and private sectors to illustrate our argument and identify some key policy and implementation recommendations.},

Decentralization as a reform measure aims to improve inputs, management processes and health outcomes, and has political, administrative and financial connotations. It is argued that the robustness of a health system in achieving desirable outcomes is contingent upon the width and depth of `decision space' at the local level. Studies have used different approaches to examine one or more facets of decentralization and its effect on health system functioning; however, lack of consensus on an acceptable framework is a critical gap in determining its quantum and quality. Theorists have resorted to concepts of `trust', `convenience' and `mutual benefits' to explain, define and measure components of governance in health. In the emerging `continuum of health services' model, the challenge lies in identifying variables of performance (fiscal allocation, autonomy at local level, perception of key stakeholders, service delivery outputs, etc.) through the prism of decentralization in the first place, and in establishing directed relationships among them.},

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.},

The community based information systems were part of a national system and the usefulness of comparing local data with data from other communities and from across the country in pursuing equity in health services provision is demonstrated. A community based information system is thus benefiting from being part of and integrated with the larger national system. The article presents and discusses community based participatory approaches to developing information systems which are enabling the community to take ownership and `cultivate' culturally appropriate systems.

  abstract = {Implementation research is a multidisciplinary field that addresses the complex phenomenon of how context influences our ability to deliver evidenceinformed healthcare. There is increasing realisation of the importance of applying robust implementation research to scale-up life-saving interventions that meet health-related sustainable development goals. However, the lack of high-quality implementation research is impeding our ability to meet these targets, globally. Within implementation research, theory refers to the proposed hypothesis and/or explanation of how an intervention is expected to interact with the local context and actors to bring about change. Although there is increasing interest in applying theory to understand how and why implementation programmes work in real-world settings, global health actors still tend to favour impact evaluations conducted in controlled environments. This may, in part, be due to the relative novelty as well as methodological complexity of implementation research and the need to draw on divergent disciplines, including epidemiology, implementation science and social sciences. Because of this, implementation research is faced with a particular set of challenges about how to reconcile different ways of thinking and constructing knowledge about healthcare interventions. To help translate some of the ambiguity surrounding how divergent theoretical approaches and methods contribute to implementation research, we draw on our multidisciplinary expertise in the field, particularly in global health. We offer an overview of the different theoretical approaches and describe how they are applied to continuously select, monitor and evaluate implementation strategies throughout the different phases of implementation research. In doing so, we offer a relatively brief, user-focused guide to help global health actors implement and report on evaluation of evidencebased and scalable interventions, programmes and practices.},

It was the subject of more than 50 academic articles between January and December 2020, appeared as a new area covered in numerous conferences, and featured in public statements by leaders of global health organisations. Although its aims have not been formally defined, we see `decolonising global health' as a movement that fights against ingrained systems of dominance and power in the work to improve the health of populations, whether this occurs between countries, including between previously colonising and plundered nations, and within countries, for example the privileging of what Connell calls research-based knowledge formation over the lived experience of people themselves.1 2 It is well documented---although often overlooked---that global health has evolved from colonial and tropical medicine, which were `designed to control colonised populations and make political and economic exploitation by European and North American powers easier'.3 The operations of many organisations active in global health thus perpetuate the very power imbalances they claim to rectify, through colonial and extractive attitudes, and policies and practices that concentrate resources, expertise, data and branding within high-income country (HIC) institutions.4 5 As a group of global health practitioners from different backgrounds, we reflect on our personal and professional experiences of systems and processes that institutionalise power imbalances. In this article, we propose a roadmap for global health practitioners, like us, who want to see rhetoric turn into reforms, focusing on systemic changes needed in organisations led from HICs.

  abstract = {Background: Maternal and child health (MCH) is a global health concern, especially impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Digital health technologies are creating opportunities to address the social determinants of MCH by facilitating access to information and providing other forms of support throughout the maternity journey. Previous reviews in different disciplines have synthesized digital health intervention outcomes in LMIC. However, contributions in this space are scattered across publications in different disciplines and lack coherence in what digital MCH means across fields. Objective: This cross-disciplinary scoping review synthesized the existing published literature in 3 major disciplines on the use of digital health interventions for MCH in LMIC, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley across 3 disciplines, including public health, social sciences applied to health, and human-computer interaction research in health care. We searched the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PLOS. A stakeholder consultation was undertaken to inform and validate the review. Results: During the search, 284 peer-reviewed articles were identified. After removing 41 duplicates, 141 articles met our inclusion criteria: 34 from social sciences applied to health, 58 from public health, and 49 from human-computer interaction research in health care. These articles were then tagged (labeled) by 3 researchers using a custom data extraction framework to obtain the findings. First, the scope of digital MCH was found to target health education (eg, breastfeeding and child nutrition), care and follow-up of health service use (to support community health workers), maternal mental health, and nutritional and health outcomes. These interventions included mobile apps, SMS text messaging, voice messaging, web-based applications, social media, movies and videos, and wearable or sensor-based devices. Second, we highlight key challenges: little attention has been given to understanding the lived experiences of the communities; key role players (eg, fathers, grandparents, and other family members) are often excluded; and many studies are designed considering nuclear families that do not represent the family structures of the local cultures. Conclusions: Digital MCH has shown steady growth in Africa and other LMIC settings. Unfortunately, the role of the community was negligible, as these interventions often do not include communities early and inclusively enough in the design process. We highlight key opportunities and sociotechnical challenges for digital MCH in LMIC, such as more affordable mobile data; better access to smartphones and wearable technologies; and the rise of custom-developed, culturally appropriate apps that are more suited to low-literacy users. We also focus on barriers such as an overreliance on text-based communications and the difficulty of MCH research and design to inform and translate into policy.},

  abstract = {Background: Cross-institutional interoperability between health care providers remains a recurring challenge worldwide. The German Medical Informatics Initiative, a collaboration of 37 university hospitals in Germany, aims to enable interoperability between partner sites by defining Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles for the cross-institutional exchange of health care data, the Core Data Set (CDS). The current CDS and its extension modules define elements representing patients' health care records. All university hospitals in Germany have made significant progress in providing routine data in a standardized format based on the CDS. In addition, the central research platform for health, the German Portal for Medical Research Data feasibility tool, allows medical researchers to query the available CDS data items across many participating hospitals. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate a novel approach of combining the current top-down generated FHIR profiles with the bottom-up generated knowledge gained by the analysis of respective instance data. This allowed us to derive options for iteratively refining FHIR profiles using the information obtained from a discrepancy analysis. Methods: We developed an FHIR validation pipeline and opted to derive more restrictive profiles from the original CDS profiles. This decision was driven by the need to align more closely with the specific assumptions and requirements of the central feasibility platform's search ontology. While the original CDS profiles offer a generic framework adaptable for a broad spectrum of medical informatics use cases, they lack the specificity to model the nuanced criteria essential for medical researchers. A key example of this is the necessity to represent specific laboratory codings and values interdependencies accurately. The validation results allow us to identify discrepancies between the instance data at the clinical sites and the profiles specified by the feasibility platform and addressed in the future. Results: A total of 20 university hospitals participated in this study. Historical factors, lack of harmonization, a wide range of source systems, and case sensitivity of coding are some of the causes for the discrepancies identified. While in our case study, Conditions, Procedures, and Medications have a high degree of uniformity in the coding of instance data due to legislative requirements for billing in Germany, we found that laboratory values pose a significant data harmonization challenge due to their interdependency between coding and value. Conclusions: While the CDS achieves interoperability, different challenges for federated data access arise, requiring more specificity in the profiles to make assumptions on the instance data. We further argue that further harmonization of the instance data can significantly lower required retrospective harmonization efforts. We recognize that discrepancies cannot be resolved},

  abstract = {The growing adoption and utilization of health information technology has generated a wealth of clinical data in electronic format, offering opportunities for data reuse beyond direct patient care. However, as data are distributed across multiple software, it becomes challenging to cross-reference information between sources due to differences in formats, vocabularies, technologies, and the absence of common identifiers among software. To address these challenges, hospitals have adopted data warehouses to consolidate and standardize these data for research. Additionally, as a complement or alternative, data lakes store both source data and metadata in a detailed and unprocessed format, empowering exploration, manipulation, and adaptation of the data to meet specific analytical needs. Subsequently, datamarts are utilized to further refine data into usable information tailored to specific research questions. However, for efficient analysis, a feature store is essential to pivot and denormalize the data, simplifying queries. In conclusion, while data warehouses are crucial, data lakes, datamarts and feature stores play essential and complementary roles in facilitating data reuse for research and analysis in healthcare.},

Whereas traditional firms create value within the boundaries of a company or a supply chain, digital platforms utilize an ecosystem of autonomous agents to co-create value. Scholars from various disciplines, such as economics, technology management, and information systems have taken different perspectives on~digital platform ecosystems. In this Fundamentals article, we first synthesize research on digital platforms and digital platform ecosystems to provide a definition that integrates both concepts. Second, we use this definition to explain how different digital platform ecosystems vary according to three core building blocks: (1) platform ownership, (2) value-creating mechanisms, and (3) complementor autonomy. We conclude by giving an outlook on four overarching research areas that connect the building blocks: (1) technical properties and value creation; (2) complementor interaction with the ecosystem; (3) value capture; and (4) the make-or-join decision in digital platform ecosystems.},

  abstract = {While traditional organizations create value within the boundaries of their firm or supply chain, digital platforms leverage and orchestrate a platform-mediated ecosystem to create and co-create value with a much wider array of partners and actors. Although the change to two-sided markets and their generalization to platform ecosystems have been adopted among various industries, both academic research and industry adoption have lagged behind in the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge current Information Systems research has not yet incorporated an interorganizational perspective of the digital transformation of healthcare. This neglects a wide range of emerging changes, including changing segmentation of industry market participants, changing patient segments, changing patient roles as decision makers, and their interaction in patient care. This study therefore investigates the digital transformation of the healthcare industry by analyzing 1830 healthcare organizations found on Crunchbase. We derived a generic value ecosystem of the digital healthcare industry and validated our findings with industry experts from the traditional and the start-up healthcare domains. The results indicate 8 new roles within healthcare, namely: information platforms, data collection technology, market intermediaries, services for remote and on-demand healthcare, augmented and virtual reality provider, blockchain-based PHR, cloud service provider, and intelligent data analysis for healthcare provider. Our results further illustrate how these roles transform value proposition, value capture, and value delivery in the healthcare industry. We discuss competition between new entrants and incumbents and elaborate how digital health innovations contribute to the changing role of patients.},

  abstract = {Digital platforms hold a central position in today's world economy and are said to offer a great potential for the economies and societies in the global South. Yet, to date, the scholarly literature on digital platforms has largely concentrated on business while their developmental implications remain understudied. In part, this is because digital platforms are a challenging research object due to their lack of conceptual definition, their spread across different regions and industries, and their intertwined nature with institutions, actors and digital technologies. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the ongoing debate in information systems and ICT4D research to understand what digital platforms mean for development. To do so, we first define what digital platforms are and differentiate between transaction and innovation platforms, and explain their key characteristics in terms of purpose, research foundations, material properties and business models. We add the socio-technical context digital platforms operate and the linkages to developmental outcomes. We then conduct an extensive review to explore what current areas, developmental goals, tensions and issues emerge in the literature on platforms and development and identify relevant gaps in our knowledge. We later elaborate on six research questions to advance the studies on digital platforms for development: on indigenous innovation, digital platforms and institutions, on exacerbation of inequalities, on alternative forms of value, on the dark side of platforms and on the applicability of the platform typology for development.},

Many design decisions have to be made at the architectural level in order to deliver an information system with the resilience property.

A corollary is derived from the CAP theorem, and states that it is impossible for a system to have all three properties of consistency, resilience and partition-tolerance. We present seven architectural constraints for resilience. The constraints are elicited from good architectural practices for developing reliable and fault-tolerant systems and the state-of-the-art technologies in distributed computing. These constraints provide a comprehensive reference for architectural design towards resilience.},

It argues that much of the resilience literature covers existing ground in that existing engineering systems stability ideas are being reinvented. The review follows modern control systems theory as the comparison framework, where each system, irrespective of its disciplinary association, is represented in terms of inputs, state, and outputs. Modern control systems theory is adopted because of its cohesiveness and universality. The review reveals that resilience can be thought of in terms of adaptive systems and adaptation, where the system has the ability to respond to perturbations and changes through passive and active feedback mechanisms---returning the system state or system form to a starting position or transitioning to another suitable state or form. This systematic and cross-disciplinary review offers the potential for a greater understanding of resilience and the elimination of overlap in the literature, particularly related to terminology.},

Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent ``resilience'' by taking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps:\, identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.},
