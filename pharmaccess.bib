  abstract = {In today's binary world, digital health is of paramount importance, primarily due to the prevalence of IoT devices, upsurging health costs, growing elderly population, and shortage of clinical providers, to name a few. In light of these, providing efficient and smarter full-stack healthcare data analytics to manage and process healthcare data is a crucial topic from both academic and professional perspectives. The key goals of this full-stack healthcare data analytics are to detect health issues and promote human-being health proactively. The existing healthcare data analytics stacks are generally classified into commercial or open-source solutions. In designing a healthcare data stack, it is critical to offer the researchers a collaborative, modular, easy-to-use, cost/time-effective, reproducible, uniform, and shared- knowledge framework. Such healthcare stacks need to pave the way for researchers to focus on developing data analytics algorithms, and the underlying infrastructure should comply with longitudinal characteristics of healthcare data. Nonetheless, the existing healthcare data analytics stacks need holistically incorporate all the parameters mentioned. In this paper, we propose a novel healthcare data analytics stack called Open-Source Portable Healthcare Analytics Stack (PHAS) to address this issue. PHAS considers the mentioned features by fusing the merits of open-source and commercial solutions at the right place in its architecture. PHAS proposes a new shared-knowledge and time-series-aware framework, which enables researchers to perform health data collection, integration, storage, visualization, and analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the capabilities of the PHAS framework by implementing an anomaly detection algorithm for heart rate and blood pressure anomaly detection using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. We provide open-source PHAS for the community to integrate into their solutions.},

  abstract = {The construction of systems supporting spatial data has experienced great enthusiasm in the past, due to the richness of this type of data and their semantics, which can be used in the decision-making process in various fields. Thus, the problem of integrating spatial data into existing databases and information systems has been addressed by creating spatial extensions to relational tables or by creating spatial data warehouses, while arranging data structures and query languages by making them more spatially-aware. With the advent of Big Data, these conventional storage and spatial representation structures are becoming increasingly outdated, and required a new organization of spatial data. Approaches based on distributed storage and data lakes have been proposed, to integrate the complexity of spatial data, with operational and analytical systems which unfortunately quickly showed their limits. Recently the concept of lakehouse was introduced in order to integrate, among other things, the notion of reliability and ACID properties to the volume of data to be managed. This new data architecture is a combination of governed and reliable Data Warehouses and flexible, scalable and cost-effective Data Lakes. In this paper, we present how traditional approaches of spatial data management in the context of spatial big data have quickly shown their limits. We present a literature overview of these approaches, and how they led to the Data LakeHouse. We detail how the Lakehouse paradigm can be used and extended for managing spatial big data, by giving the different components and best practices for building a spatial data LakeHouse architecture optimized for the storage and computing over spatial big data.},

The internet permits data of various forms to be transmitted from entity to entity; this being an important feature of information age. The ability to take advantage of this technology to improve all aspects of human life and human endeavor is one of the keys to achieving sustainable growth and development for developing countries especially in terms of health care service delivery. The availability and accessibility of Health information whenever it is needed is important in determining the effectiveness of healthcare service delivery. This brings about the need for information exchange between different health information systems with reference to the Nigerian health sector i.e. an integrated system of interoperable health information systems that can exchange data in a meaningful and coherent way. The need for standardization is identified as major factor in achieving integration and interoperability between any groups of heterogeneous systems that must function together. This research work employed the review of related literature and existing health information exchange systems to determine the strengths and flaws of existing health information exchange systems and architectural models. How they can be adapted to and used to improve the Nigerian healthcare system was also a subject matter in this study. Based on the federated model of health information exchange; an architectural model and Framework was designed to demonstrate how interoperability can be achieved. Architectural models and Frameworks were designed to suit Nigeria's unique healthcare structure while supporting the designed architectural models with the development of an API using the federated model of health information exchange. Data was transferred between health information systems in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format using the developed API. The study concluded that the development of health information exchange Standards that conform to existing health information exchange reference models by the collaboration of medical and Information technology bodies in Nigeria would allow for a nationally integrated and interoperable health care system.},

We theorize how the ongoing technological developments reinforce the traditional functions of data as instruments of management and control but also reframe and extend their role. By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulfil in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, and physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns, and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative significance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.},

However, it is challenged by weaknesses inherent in the communication infrastructure that support such data sharing. A key challenge has been pinned on the poor standardisation of digital health systems that make up the communication infrastructure thereby affecting the collection, processing, storage and transmission of health data/client's electronic medical records. This chapter presents experiences from Uganda regards progress in standardisation. A scoping literature review informed conceptualisation of digital health standardisation to involve setting standards context, standards development process, and implementation plus compliance monitoring. These three constructs guided the exploration of Uganda's state of digital health standardisation, conducted in four regions of the country. Whereas qualitative data collected were analysed using a thematic approach, the quantitative data was statistically analysed. Findings showed unstandardised implementations of digital health devices and applications, disparate and intermittent network connectivity with poor quality of service, limited digital health use skills, and inadequate facilitating resources. Further exploration attributed these limitations to weaknesses in the standardisation process and a lack of contextual standards to guide digital health implementations. Further works will develop a framework for fast-tracking the standardisation of the digital health communication infrastructure in low-resource health systems like Uganda.},

  abstract = {Background: The increasing use of electronic health records and the Internet of Things has led to interoperability issues at different levels (structural and semantic). Standards are important not only for successfully exchanging data but also for appropriately interpreting them (semantic interoperability). Thus, to facilitate the semantic interoperability of data exchanged in health care, considerable resources have been deployed to improve the quality of shared clinical data by structuring and mapping them to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Objective: The aims of this study are 2-fold: to inventory the studies on FHIR semantic interoperability resources and terminologies and to identify and classify the approaches and contributions proposed in these studies. Methods: A systematic mapping review (SMR) was conducted using 10 electronic databases as sources of information for inventory and review studies published during 2012 to 2022 on the development and improvement of semantic interoperability using the FHIR standard. Results: A total of 70 FHIR studies were selected and analyzed to identify FHIR resource types and terminologies from a semantic perspective. The proposed semantic approaches were classified into 6 categories, namely mapping (31/126, 24.6\%), terminology services (18/126, 14.3\%), resource description framework or web ontology language--based proposals (24/126, 19\%), annotation proposals (18/126, 14.3\%), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) proposals (20/126, 15.9\%), and ontology-based proposals (15/126, 11.9\%). From 2012 to 2022, there has been continued research in 6 categories of approaches as well as in new and emerging annotations and ML and NLP proposals. This SMR also classifies the contributions of the selected studies into 5 categories: framework or architecture proposals, model proposals, technique proposals, comparison services, and tool proposals. The most frequent type of contribution is the proposal of a framework or architecture to enable semantic interoperability. Conclusions: This SMR provides a classification of the different solutions proposed to address semantic interoperability using FHIR at different levels: collecting, extracting and annotating data, modeling electronic health record data from legacy systems, and applying transformation and mapping to FHIR models and terminologies. The use of ML and NLP for unstructured data is promising and has been applied to specific use case scenarios. In addition, terminology services are needed to accelerate their use and adoption; furthermore, techniques and tools to automate annotation and ontology comparison should help reduce human interaction.},

  abstract = {Background: Rise of conflict, extreme weather events, and pandemics have led to larger displaced populations worldwide. Displaced populations have unique acute and chronic health needs that must be met by low-resource health systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been shown to improve health outcomes in displaced populations, but need to be adapted to meet the constraints of these health systems. Objective: The aim of this viewpoint is to describe the development and deployment of an EHR designed to care for displaced populations in low-resource settings. Methods: Using a human-centered design approach, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients, health care providers, and administrators in Lebanon and Jordan to identify the essential EHR features. These features, including modular workflows, multilingual interfaces, and offline-first capabilities, led to the development of the Hikma Health EHR, which has been deployed in Lebanon and Nicaragua. Results: We report the successes and challenges from 12 months of Hikma Health EHR deployment in a mobile clinic providing care to Syrian refugees in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Successes include the EHR's ability to (1) increase clinical efficacy by providing detailed patient records, (2) be adaptable to the threats of COVID-19, and (3) improve organizational planning. Lessons learned include technical fixes to methods of identifying patients through name or their medical record ID. Conclusions: As the number of displaced people continues to rise globally, it is imperative that solutions are created to help maximize the health care they receive. Free, open-sourced, and adaptable EHRs can enable organizations to better provide for displaced populations.},

  abstract = {Background Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.},

Methods We designed a quasi-experimental study using observational data from a large mobile health wallet programme, with the exposure as pregnancy risk at the first ANC visit, measured on a binary scale (low vs high). Complications during pregnancy and at labour or delivery were the study outcomes on a binary scale (yes vs no). Causal effects of the exposure were examined using a double-robust estimation, reported as an OR with a 95\% CI. Results We studied 4419 women aged 10--49 years (mean, 25.6{\textpm}6.27 years), with the majority aged 20--29 years (53.4\%) and rural residents (87.4\%). Of 3271 women with low-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit, 833 (25.5\%) had complications during pregnancy while 1074 (32.8\%) had complications at labour/delivery. Conversely, of 1148 women with high-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit, 343 (29.9\%) had complication during pregnancy while 488 (42.5\%) had complications at labour delivery. Multivariable adjusted analysis showed that women with high-risk pregnancy at the time of first ANC attendance had a higher occurrence of pregnancy during pregnancy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.22, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.46) and labour or delivery (aOR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.41). In the double-robust estimation, a high-risk pregnancy at first ANC visit increased the occurrence of complications during pregnancy (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.46) and labour or delivery (OR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07 to 1.45). Conclusion Women with a high-risk pregnancy at the first ANC visit have an increased occurrence of complications during pregnancy and labour or delivery. These women should be identified early for close and appropriate obstetric and intrapartum monitoring and care to ensure maternal and neonatal survival.},

Additionally, depending on the specific application field, paramount importance is given to the possibility for the humans to understand why a certain AI/ML-based application is providing that specific output. In this paper, we discuss the concept of Federated Learning of eXplainable AI (XAI) models, in short FED-XAI, purposely designed to address these two requirements simultaneously. AI/ML models are trained with the simultaneous goals of preserving the data privacy (Federated Learning (FL) side) and ensuring a certain level of explainability of the system (XAI side). We first introduce the motivations at the foundation of FL and XAI, along with their basic concepts; then, we discuss the current status of this field of study, providing a brief survey regarding approaches, models, and results. Finally, we highlight the main future challenges.},

  abstract = {When developing large data processing systems, the question of data storage arises. One of the modern tools for solving this problem is the so-called data lakes. Many implementations of data lakes use Apache Hadoop as a basic platform. Hadoop does not have a default data storage format, which leads to the task of choosing a data format when designing a data processing system. To solve this problem, it is necessary to proceed from the results of the assessment according to several criteria. In turn, experimental evaluation does not always give a complete understanding of the possibilities for working with a particular data storage format. In this case, it is necessary to study the features of the format, its internal structure, recommendations for use, etc. The article describes the features of both widely used data storage formats and the currently gaining popularity.},

  abstract = {Recently, significant milestones have been achieved in the field of healthcare data analysis. However, alongside these accomplishments, substantial data-related challenges have emerged in the domain of big data management. Modern healthcare projects are no more dealing with a single data repository but many heterogeneous ones and must overcome data variety, privacy and governance issues. Yet, current solutions face a privacy-decentralization trade-off. To address this dual challenge, we introduce HealthMesh, a novel layered architectural framework based on the Data Mesh principles, providing a domaindecentralised paradigm. In addition, the framework incorporates a Semantic Data Model which establishes robust governance, enables interoperability and guarantees policy compliance for all the data assets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, we provide an illustrative example inspired by the use case of the INCISIVE project for breast cancer analytics. Overall, this work makes a significant contribution on collecting key challenges, identifying actors and providing a set of components and guidelines for establishing a holistic framework for the complex field of healthcare data management.},

  abstract = {Background: Years of health information system investment in many countries have facilitated service delivery, surveillance, reporting, and monitoring. Electricity, computing hardware, and internet networks are vital for health facility--based information systems. Availability of these infrastructures at health facilities is crucial for achieving national digital health visions. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the state of computing hardware, electricity, and connectivity infrastructure at health facilities in Sierra Leone using a representative sample. Methods: Stratified sampling of 72 (out of 1284) health facilities distributed in all districts of Sierra Leone was performed, factoring in the rural-urban divide, digital health activity, health facility type, and health facility ownership. Enumerators visited each health facility over a 2-week period. Results: Among the 72 surveyed health facilities, 59 (82\%) do not have institutionally provided internet. Among the 15 Maternal and Child Health Posts, as a type of primary health care unit (PHU), 9 (60\%) use solar energy as their only electricity source and the other 6 (40\%) have no electricity source. Similarly, among the 13 hospitals, 5 (38\%) use a generator as a primary electricity source. All hospitals have at least one functional computer, although only 7 of the 13 hospitals have four or more functional computers. Similarly, only 2 of the 59 (3\%) PHUs have one computer each, and 37 (63\%) of the PHUs have one tablet device each. We consider this health care computing infrastructure mapping to be representative with a 95\% confidence level within an 11\% margin of error. Two-thirds of the PHUs have only alternate solar electricity, only 10 of the 72 surveyed health facilities have functional official internet, and most use suboptimal computing hardware. Overall, 43\% of the surveyed health facilities believe that inadequate electricity is the biggest threat to digitization. Similarly, 16 (22\%) of the 72 respondents stated that device theft is a primary hindrance to digitization. Conclusions: Electricity provision for off-electricity-grid health facilities using alternative and renewable energy sources is emerging. The current trend where GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) service providers provide the internet to all health facilities may change to other promising alternatives. This study provides evidence of the critical infrastructure gaps in health facilities in Sierra Leone.},

  abstract = {Federated learning initiatives in healthcare are being developed to collaboratively train predictive models without the need to centralize sensitive personal data. GenoMed4All is one such project, with the goal of connecting European clinical and --omics data repositories on rare diseases through a federated learning platform. Currently, the consortium faces the challenge of a lack of well-established international datasets and interoperability standards for federated learning applications on rare diseases. This paper presents our practical approach to select and implement a Common Data Model (CDM) suitable for the federated training of predictive models applied to the medical domain, during the initial design phase of our federated learning platform. We describe our selection process, composed of identifying the consortium's needs, reviewing our functional and technical architecture specifications, and extracting a list of business requirements. We review the state of the art and evaluate three widely-used approaches (FHIR, OMOP and Phenopackets) based on a checklist of requirements and specifications. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach considering the use cases specific to our consortium as well as the generic issues of implementing a European federated learning healthcare platform. A list of lessons learned from the experience in our consortium is discussed, from the importance of establishing the proper communication channels for all stakeholders to technical aspects related to --omics data. For federated learning projects focused on secondary use of health data for predictive modeling, encompassing multiple data modalities, a phase of data model convergence is sorely needed to gather different data representations developed in the context of medical research, interoperability of clinical care software, imaging, and --omics analysis into a coherent, unified data model. Our work identifies this need and presents our experience and a list of actionable lessons learned for future work in this direction.},

Electronic health information systems provide platforms for managing large longitudinal patient records. Nigeria implemented the National Data Repository (NDR) to create a central data warehouse of all people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) while providing useful functionalities to aid decision making at different levels of program implementation.             Objective{$\quad$}We describe the Nigeria NDR and its development process, including its use for surveillance, research, and national HIV program monitoring toward achieving HIV epidemic control.             Methods{$\quad$}Stakeholder engagement meetings were held in 2013 to gather information on data elements and vocabulary standards for reporting patient-level information, technical infrastructure, human capacity requirements, and information flow. Findings from these meetings guided the development of the NDR. An implementation guide provided common terminologies and data reporting structures for data exchange between the NDR and the electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Data from the EMR were encoded in extensible markup language and sent to the NDR over secure hypertext transfer protocol after going through a series of validation processes.             Results{$\quad$}By June 30, 2021, the NDR had up-to-date records of 1,477,064 (94.4\%) patients receiving HIV treatment across 1,985 health facilities, of which 1,266,512 (85.7\%) patient records had fingerprint template data to support unique patient identification and record linkage to prevent registration of the same patient under different identities. Data from the NDR was used to support HIV program monitoring, case-based surveillance and production of products like the monthly lists of patients who have treatment interruptions and dashboards for monitoring HIV test and start.             Conclusion{$\quad$}The NDR enabled the availability of reliable and timely data for surveillance, research, and HIV program monitoring to guide program improvements to accelerate progress toward epidemic control.},

Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?},

Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n\,=\,66, 32.5\%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n\,=\,30, 14.8\%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n\,=\,24, 11.8\%), general research data sharing (n\,=\,23, 11.3\%), and management of genomic data (n\,=\,21, 10.3\%). With the exception of phenotyping (n\,=\,19, 9.4\%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself.Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities.The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.},

  abstract = {Electronic health record systems work beyond just recording patients` health data. They have multiple secondary functionalities, such as data reporting and clinical decision support. As each of these systems` workloads has contradictory different needs, managing a multipurpose electronic health record is a challenge. This paper proposes a unified healthcare data framework that can simplify health information system infrastructure. It investigates the suitability of the documentbased NoSQL persistence mechanism, storing electronic health records data as a design choice for managing varied complexity ad hoc queries used in operational business intelligence. The performance of the most popular two document-based NoSQL back-ends, Couchbase Server and MongoDB, is compared according to the size of the database and query execution time. Results showed that while MongoDB can execute simple singledocument queries nearly in milliseconds. It does not provide satisfactory response time for unplanned complex queries spanning multiple documents. By utilizing its analytics services and multi-dimensional scaling architecture, Couchbase Server multi-node cluster outperforms the response times of MongoDB for both simple and complex healthcare data access patterns. The primary advantage of the proposed tightly coupled EHRs processing framework is its flexibility to manage workload according to changing requirements.},

This fragmentation poses a major challenge for data-intensive ML applications: integrating and transforming data residing in different sources demand a lot of manual work and computational resources. With data privacy and security constraints, data often cannot leave the premises of data silos, hence model training should proceed in a decentralized manner. In this work, we present a vision of how to bridge the traditional data integration (DI) techniques with the requirements of modern machine learning. We explore the possibilities of utilizing metadata obtained from data integration processes for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of ML models. Towards this direction, we analyze two common use cases over data silos, feature augmentation and federated learning. Bringing data integration and machine learning together, we highlight new research opportunities from the aspects of systems, representations, factorized learning and federated learning.},

A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes.

  abstract = {For most large enterprises today, data constitutes their core asset, along with code and infrastructure. For most enterprises, the amount of data that they produce internally has exploded in recent years. At the same time, in many cases, engineers and data scientists do not use centralized data-management systems and end up creating what became known as a data lake---a collection of datasets that often are not well organized or not organized at all and where one needs to ``fish'' for useful datasets. In this paper, we describe our experience building and deploying GOODS, a system to manage Google's internal data lake. GOODS crawls Google's infrastructure and builds a catalog of discovered datasets, including structured files, databases, spreadsheets, and even services that provide access to the data. GOODS extracts metadata about datasets in a post-hoc way: engineers continue to generate and organize datasets in the same way that they have before, and GOODS provides value without disrupting teams' practices. The technical challenges that we had to address resulted both from the scale and heterogeneity of Google's data lake and from our decision to extract metadata in a post-hoc manner. We believe that many of the lessons that we learned are applicable to building large-scale enterprise-level data-management systems in general.},

The need to produce actionable knowledge fast from unstructured data ingested from distributed sources requires a marriage of data warehouses and data lakes to create a data Lakehouse (LH). The objective is to use the strengths of the data warehouse in producing insights fast from processed merged data, and of the data lake in ingesting and storing high-speed unstructured data with post-storage transformation and analytics capabilities.

  abstract = {Background: eHealth increasingly affects the delivery of health care around the world and the quest for more efficient health systems. In Finland, the development of eHealth maturity has been systematically studied since 2003, through surveys conducted every 3 years. It has also been monitored in several international studies. The indicators used in these studies examined the availability of the electronic patient record, picture archiving and communication system, health information exchange, and other key eHealth functionalities. Objective: The first aim is to study the national development in the maturity level of eHealth in primary health care and specialized care between 2011 and 2020 in Finland. The second aim is to clarify the regional differences in the maturity level of eHealth among Finnish hospital districts in 2020. Methods: Data for this study were collected in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, using web-based questionnaires from the Use of information and communication technology surveys in Finnish health care project. In total, 16 indicators were selected to describe the status of eHealth, and they were based on international eHealth studies and Finnish eHealth surveys in 3 areas: applications, regional integration, and data security and information and communications technology skills. The indicators remain the same in all the study years; therefore, the results are comparable. Results: All the specialized care organizations (21/21, 100\%) in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 participated in the study. The response rate among primary health care organizations was 86.3\% (139/161) in 2011, 88.2\% (135/153) in 2014, 85.8\% (121/141) in 2017, and 95.6\% (130/136) in 2020. At the national level, the biggest developments in eHealth maturity occurred between 2011 and 2014. The development has since continued, and some indicators have been saturated. Primary health care lags behind specialized care organizations, as measured by all the indicators and throughout the period under review. Regionally, there are differences among different types of organizations. Conclusions: eHealth maturity has steadily progressed in Finland nationally, and its implementation has also been promoted through various national strategies and legislative changes. Some eHealth indicators have already been saturated and achieved an intensity of use rate of 100\%. However, the scope for development remains, especially in primary health care. As Finland has long been a pioneer in the digitalization of health care, the results of this study show that the functionalities of eHealth will be adopted in stages, and deployment will take time; therefore, national eHealth strategies and legislative changes need to be implemented in a timely manner. The comprehensive sample size used in this study allows a regional comparison in the country, compared with previous country-specific international studies.},

Objective: To systematically review the available research on HIE outcomes and analyze future research needs. Methods: Data sources included citations from selected databases from January 1990 to February 2015. We included English-language studies of HIE in clinical or public health settings in any country. Data were extracted using dual review with adjudication of disagreements. Results: We identified 34 studies on outcomes of HIE. No studies reported on clinical outcomes (eg, mortality and morbidity) or identified harms. Low-quality evidence generally finds that HIE reduces duplicative laboratory and radiology testing, emergency department costs, hospital admissions (less so for readmissions), and improves public health reporting, ambulatory quality of care, and disability claims processing. Most clinicians attributed positive changes in care coordination, communication, and knowledge about patients to HIE. Conclusions: Although the evidence supports benefits of HIE in reducing the use of specific resources and improving the quality of care, the full impact of HIE on clinical outcomes and potential harms are inadequately studied. Future studies must address comprehensive questions, use more rigorous designs, and employ a standard for describing types of HIE.

  abstract = {In recent years, data lakes emerged as away to manage large amounts of heterogeneous data for modern data analytics. One way to prevent data lakes from turning into inoperable data swamps is semantic data management. Some approaches propose the linkage of metadata to knowledge graphs based on the Linked Data principles to provide more meaning and semantics to the data in the lake. Such a semantic layer may be utilized not only for data management but also to tackle the problem of data integration from heterogeneous sources, in order to make data access more expressive and interoperable. In this survey, we review recent approaches with a specific focus on the application within data lake systems and scalability to Big Data. We classify the approaches into (i) basic semantic data management, (ii) semantic modeling approaches for enriching metadata in data lakes, and (iii) methods for ontologybased data access. In each category, we cover the main techniques and their background, and compare latest research. Finally, we point out challenges for future work in this research area, which needs a closer integration of Big Data and Semantic Web technologies.},

  abstract = {In low-and middle-income countries, achieving universal health coverage remains challenging due to insufficient, temporary and fragmented funding as well as limited accessibility to quality healthcare. Leveraging a mobile health platform can be a powerful tool to address these problems. This paper demonstrates how analysing data collected from a mobile health platform helps optimize healthcare provider networks, monitor patient flows and assess the quality and equitability of access to care. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the importance of real-time data on health-seeking behaviour. Between 2018 and 2019, as a Kenyan universal health coverage pilot was being planned, Kisumu County, with support from PharmAccess Foundation, implemented household-level digital registration for healthcare and collected socio-economic and healthcare claims data using the M-TIBA platform. In total, 273,350 Kisumu households enrolled. The claims data showed many patients visit higher-level facilities for ailments, that can be treated at primary care levels, unnecessarily. High-level estimate of the disease burden at participating facilities revealed rampant overprescription of pertinent medicines for highly prevalent malaria and respiratory tract infections, exemplifying clinical management deficiencies. M-TIBA data allowed tracking of individual patient trajectories. Analyses of data are shown at the aggregate level. The paper shows how mobile health platforms can be used to generate valuable insights into access to and quality of care. Funding for healthcare can be united through mobile health platforms, limiting the fragmentation in funding. They can be useful for funders, health managers and policymakers to improve the implementation of universal health coverage programs in low-and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Lakehouse storage systems that implement ACID transactions and other management features over data lake storage, such as Delta Lake, Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg, have rapidly grown in popularity, replacing traditional data lakes at many organizations. These open storage systems with rich management features promise to simplify management of large datasets, accelerate SQL workloads, and offer fast, direct file access for other workloads, such as machine learning. However, the research community has not explored the tradeoffs in designing lakehouse systems in detail. In this paper, we analyze the designs of the three most popular lakehouse storage systems---Delta Lake, Hudi and Iceberg---and compare their performance and features among varying axes based on these designs. We also release a simple benchmark, LHBench, that researchers can use to compare other designs. LHBench is available at https://github.com/lhbench/lhbench.},

  abstract = {Background Digital health solutions are a potent and complementary intervention in health system strengthening to accelerate universal access to health services. Implementing scalable, sustainable, and integrated digital solutions in a coordinated manner is necessary to experience the benefits of digital interventions in health systems. We sought to establish the breadth and scope of available digital health interventions (DHIs) and their functions in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the Joanne Briggs Institute's reviewers manual and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and explanation. We retrieved data from the WHO Digital Health Atlas (DHA), the WHO e-Health country profiles report of 2015, and electronic databases. The protocol has been deposited in an open-source platform -- the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/5kzq7. Results The researchers retrieved 983 digital tools used to strengthen health systems in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 10 years. We included 738 DHIs in the analysis while 245 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. We observed a disproportionate distribution of DHIs towards service delivery (81.7\%, n\,=\,603), health care providers (91.8\%, n\,=\,678), and access and use of information (84.1\%, n\,=\,621). Fifty-three percent (53.4\%, n\,=\,394) of the solutions are established and 47.5\% (n\,=\,582) were aligned to 20\% (n\,=\,5) of the system categories. Conclusions Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed with digital health solutions in both numbers and distinct functions. It is lacking in coordination, integration, scalability, sustainability, and equitable distribution of investments in digital health. Digital health policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa need to urgently institute coordination mechanisms to terminate unending duplication and disjointed vertical implementations and manage solutions for scale. Central to this would be to build digital health leadership in countries within SSA, adopt standards and interoperability frameworks; advocate for more investments into lagging components, and promote multi-purpose solutions to halt the seeming ``e-chaos'' and progress to sustainable e-health solutions.},

In this paper, I want the reader to grapple with the specifics of how to build and grow such a business.  To this end, I have proposed three fundamental business models - Distributor, Software producer [GPL and non-GPL] and the Third-Party Service Provider.  These are sustainable models that can lead to robust revenue streams.  The business models provided here can be enhanced by the addition of further revenue streams.  For instance, we now know that certification of developers on an Open-Source product can lead to strong revenues.  Not all products have the same profit potential.  Therefore, not all Open Source Software products have the same profit potential.  I have classified Open Source Software products into four categories - Stars, High-profile nichers, Low-profile nichers and Mainstream utilities.  Businesses can be built around Stars.  High-profile nichers can lead to robust revenue streams if properly marketed.  The other two categories may not lead to high profits.  Since many Open Source Software products are freely available, managers must scan public repositories to find out which products will be suitable for their business.  The future of Open Source Software is bright.  Increasingly, we will find that these products will take a central role in the realm of software and will find a larger place in all our lives.},

Its purpose is to assess the implementation factors, strengths and weaknesses of GoTHOMIS on healthcare services in Tanzania. The research employs a PAR methodology involving stakeholders from healthcare facilities, administrators, and I.T. experts. Data collection methods include document evaluation and interviews with key informants. The findings highlight significant areas for improvement in the implementation process, characterized by a top-down approach and a lack of user participation, hindering the system's successful adoption. Inadequate infrastructure, including network connectivity and outdated hardware, posed further challenges. Compatibility issues with peripheral devices and usability problems were also identified. Despite the challenges, GoTHOMIS demonstrated strengths such as improved accessibility, integration with the MTUHA reporting system, and automation of clinical tasks---weaknesses, including some system components, were only partially automated, which caused inefficiencies in the delivery of healthcare services and failure in integrating with other existing healthcare systems and data sources. Limitations of the study include a focus on selected healthcare facilities, limiting generalizability, and reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce biases. The study's originality lies in applying a PAR approach to assess GoTHOMIS, providing valuable insights into implementation challenges and potential improvements.},

  abstract = {Lack of interoperability and integration between heterogeneous health systems is a big challenge to realize the potential benefits of eHealth. To best move from siloed applications to interoperable eHealth solutions, health information exchange (HIE) policy and standards are necessary to be established. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the current status of HIE policy and standards on the African continent. Therefore, this paper aimed to systematically review the status of HIE policy and standards which are currently in practice in Africa. A systematic search of the literature was conducted from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Scopus, Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and a total of 32 papers (21 strategic documents and 11 peer-reviewed papers) were selected based on predefined criteria for synthesis. Results revealed that African countries have paid attention to the development, improvement, adoption, and implementation of HIE architecture for interoperability and standards. Synthetic and semantic interoperability standards were identified for the implementation of HIE in Africa. Based on this comprehensive review, we recommend that comprehensive interoperable technical standards should be set at each national level and should be guided by appropriate governance and legal frameworks, data ownership and use agreements, and health data privacy and security guidelines. On top of the policy issues, there is a need to identify a set of standards (health system standards, communication, messaging standards, terminology/vocabulary standards, patient profile standards, privacy and security, and risk assessment) and implement them throughout all levels of the health system. On top of this, we recommend that the Africa Union (AU) and regional bodies provide the necessary human resource and high-level technical support to African countries to implement HIE policy and standards. To realize the full potential of eHealth in the continent, it is recommended that African countries need to have a common HIE policy, interoperable technical standards, and health data privacy and security guidelines. Currently, there is an ongoing effort by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) towards promoting HIE on the continent. A task force has been established from Africa CDC, Health Information Service Provider (HISP) partners, and African and global HIE subject matter experts to provide expertise and guidance in the development of AU policy and standards for HIE. Although the work is still ongoing, the African Union shall continue to support the implementation of HIE policy and standards in the continent. The authors of this review are currently working under the umbrella of the African Union to develop the HIE policy and standard to be endorsed by the head of states of the Africa Union. As a follow-up publication to this, the result will be published in mid-2022.},

It is well understood that without digital health technologies, countries will face difficulties in tackling the needs and demands of their population. Global agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations (UN), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), etc. have been instrumental in providing various tools, and guidance through digital health strategies in improving health and digital health maturity of the countries. The Digital Health Platform Handbook (DHPH) is a toolkit published by WHO and ITU to help countries create and implement a digital health platform (DHP) to serve as the underlying infrastructure for an interoperable and integrated national digital health system. We apply the foundational principles of DHPH and provide a perspective of DHP components in a layered, enterprise architecture of a digital health infrastructure. India has rolled out the blueprint of its National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) to address the emerging needs for digitization of healthcare in the country. In this paper, we also illustrate the design and implementation of WHO-ITU DHP components at the national level by exploring India's digital health mission implementation utilizing various digital public goods to build a digital health ecosystem in the country.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems designed for Online Analytical Processing (RDBMS-OLAP) have been foundational to democratizing data and enabling analytical use cases such as business intelligence and reporting for many years. However, RDBMS-OLAP systems present some well-known challenges. They are primarily optimized only for relational workloads, lead to proliferation of data copies which can become unmanageable, and since the data is stored in proprietary formats, it can lead to vendor lock-in, restricting access to engines, tools, and capabilities beyond what the vendor offers. As the demand for data-driven decision making surges, the need for a more robust data architecture to address these challenges becomes ever more critical. Cloud data lakes have addressed some of the shortcomings of RDBMS-OLAP systems, but they present their own set of challenges. More recently, organizations have often followed a two-tier architectural approach to take advantage of both these platforms, leveraging both cloud data lakes and RDBMS-OLAP systems. However, this approach brings additional challenges, complexities, and overhead. This paper discusses how a data lakehouse, a new architectural approach, achieves the same benefits of an RDBMS-OLAP and cloud data lake combined, while also providing additional advantages. We take today's data warehousing and break it down into implementation independent components, capabilities, and practices. We then take these aspects and show how a lakehouse architecture satisfies them. Then, we go a step further and discuss what additional capabilities and benefits a lakehouse architecture provides over an RDBMS-OLAP.},

Our focus is predominantly on the value of and concerns with regard to the application of digital health within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is in LMICs and marginalized communities that mHealth (within the wider scope of digital health) could be most useful and valuable. Peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs provides reassurance of this potential, often reflecting on the ubiquity of mobile phones and ever-increasing connectivity globally, reaching remote or otherwise disengaged populations. Efforts to adapt successful programs for LMIC contexts and populations are only just starting to reap rewards. Private-sector investment in mHealth offers value through enhanced capacity and advances in technology as well as the ability to meet increasing consumer demand for real-time, accessible, convenient, and choice-driven health care options. We examine some of the potential considerations associated with a private-sector investment, questioning whether a core of transparency, local ownership, equity, and safety is likely to be upheld in the current environment of health entrepreneurship.},

Healthcare practitioners are all too often left without access to large sections of their patients' medical records due to their being recording on any one of a plethora of alternative EHR systems. This not only limits their ability to make well-informed clinical decisions, but also the quality of care they are able to provide.

Software code, documentation, and technical documents were released under an open-source license. Multi-modal federated averaging is illustrated using the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. To date, 8 out of the 9 participating sites have successfully deployed the platform, with a total enrolment of \&gt;1M patients. Mapping data from legacy systems to FHIR was the biggest barrier to implementation.The CODA platform was developed and successfully deployed in a public healthcare setting in Canada, with heterogeneous information technology systems and capabilities. Ongoing efforts will use the platform to develop and prospectively validate models for risk assessment, proactive monitoring, and resource usage. Further work will also make tools available to facilitate migration from legacy formats to FHIR and DICOM.},

Drawing on our on-going ethnographic and anthropological research in Kenya and Tanzania, this article explores the dynamic, varied, experimental, and increasingly financialised terrain of formal digital health projects. While innovation in digital health is a growing feature of healthcare across the globe, in East Africa it is entering into a region already long characterised by NGOised, fragmented and vertical healthcare systems and heavy dependence on foreign capital. This presents challenges to efforts, including the WHO's Universal Health Coverage agenda, to foster national and equitable public healthcare systems. In exploring these issues, we recognise the power, and often deleterious effects, of financial capital that foregrounds markets in global digital health, but we also open space for a (still critical) recognition of East African-led digital and data technology movements.},

The assessment was undertaken by eHealth stakeholder representatives primarily from the Ministry of Health's Digital Health Technical Working Group. The toolkit focused on three major domains: leadership and governance, human resources and technology. Results{\enspace} Most domains are at the lowest two levels of maturity: nascent or emerging. At the nascent level, HIS activities happen by chance or represent isolated, ad hoc efforts. An emerging maturity level characterises a system with defined HIS processes and structures. However, such processes are not systematically documented and lack ongoing monitoring mechanisms. Conclusion{\enspace} None of the domains had a maturity level greater than level 2 (emerging). The subdomains of governance structures for HIS, defined national enterprise architecture for HIS, defined technical standards for data exchange, nationwide communication network infrastructure, and capacity for operations and maintenance of hardware attained higher maturity levels. These findings are similar to those from interoperability maturity assessments done in Ghana and Uganda.},

  abstract = {The requirement for specialization in data management systems has evolved faster than our software development practices. After decades of organic growth, this situation has created a siloed landscape composed of hundreds of products developed and maintained as monoliths, with limited reuse between systems. This fragmentation has resulted in developers often reinventing the wheel, increased maintenance costs, and slowed down innovation. It has also affected the end users, who are often required to learn the idiosyncrasies of dozens of incompatible SQL and non-SQL API dialects, and settle for systems with incomplete functionality and inconsistent semantics. In this vision paper, considering the recent popularity of open source projects aimed at standardizing different aspects of the data stack, we advocate for a paradigm shift in how data management systems are designed. We believe that by decomposing these into a modular stack of reusable components, development can be streamlined while creating a more consistent experience for users. Towards that goal, we describe the state-ofthe-art, principal open source technologies, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will foster collaboration, motivate further research, and promote a more composable future for data management.},

  abstract = {In order to maximize the value of electronic health records (EHRs) for both health care and secondary use, it is necessary for the data to be interoperable and reusable without loss of the original meaning and context, in accordance with the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles. To achieve this, it is essential for health data platforms to incorporate standards that facilitate addressing needs such as formal modeling of clinical knowledge (health domain concepts) as well as the harmonized persistence, query, and exchange of data across different information systems and organizations. However, the selection of these specifications has not been consistent across the different health data initiatives, often applying standards to address needs for which they were not originally designed. This issue is essential in the current scenario of implementing the European Health Data Space, which advocates harmonization, interoperability, and reuse of data without regulating the specific standards to be applied for this purpose. Therefore, this viewpoint aims to establish a coherent, agnostic, and homogeneous framework for the use of the most impactful EHR standards in the new-generation health data spaces: OpenEHR, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13606, and Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Thus, a panel of EHR standards experts has discussed several critical points to reach a consensus that will serve decision-making teams in health data platform projects who may not be experts in these EHR standards. It was concluded that these specifications possess different capabilities related to modeling, flexibility, and implementation resources. Because of this, in the design of future data platforms, these standards must be applied based on the specific needs they were designed for, being likewise fully compatible with their combined functional and technical implementation.},

The recent, increasing adoption of a common standard, i.e., the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), makes it easier to exchange medical data among the several parties involved, for example, in an epidemiological research activity. However, this exchange process is hindered by regulatory frameworks due to privacy issues related to the presence of personal information, which allows patients to be identified directly (or indirectly) from their medical data. When properly used, de-identification techniques can provide crucial support in overcoming these problems. FHIR-DIET aims to bring flexibility and concreteness to the implementation of de-identification of health data, supporting many customised data-processing behaviours that can be easily configured and tailored to match specific use case requirements. Our solution enables faster and easier cooperation between legal and IT professionals to establish and implement de-identification rules. The performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of processing hundreds of FHIR patient information data per second using standard hardware. We believe FHIR-DIET can be a valuable tool to satisfy the current regulation requirements and help to create added-value for the secondary use of healthcare data.},

Furthermore, to explore the possibility of maximizing analysis capabilities for our data set, we subsequently mapped the FHIR elements to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM).

  abstract = {In Kenya, early coronavirus disease (COVID-19) modeling studies predicted that disruptions in antenatal care and hospital services could increase indirect maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths. As the Kenyan government enforced lockdowns and a curfew, many mothers-to-be were unable to safely reach hospital facilities, especially at night. Fear of contracting COVID-19, increasing costs of accessing care, stigma, and falling incomes forced many expectant mothers to give birth at home. MomCare, which primarily serves communities in remote areas and urban slums, links mothers-to-be with payers and health care providers, following a standardized pregnancy program based on World Health Organization guidelines at a predetermined cost and quality. Expectant mothers gain access to care through a mobile wallet on their feature phone (voice, text, and basic internet), and providers are paid after appropriate care is given. Within the first 3 weeks of the pandemic in Kenya, the following services were added to the MomCare bundle: emergency ambulance services during curfew hours, extended bed allowances to encourage early care, phone calls to check on mothers approaching their delivery dates and to promote the generation of a birth plan, SMS messages to inform mothers of open facilities and COVID-19 protocols, and training for clinic staff in managing COVID-19 patients and infection prevention. We compare data collected through the MomCare platform during the 6 months before the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Kenya (September 2019--February 2020) with data collected during the 6 months that followed. This study shows that care-seeking behaviors (enrollment, antenatal/postnatal care, skilled deliveries) increased for mothers-to-be enrolled in MomCare during the COVID-19 lockdowns, while quality of care and outcomes were maintained. Public health practitioners can promote interactive, patient-driven technology like MomCare to augment traditional responses, quickly linking payments with patients and providers in times of crisis.},

  abstract = {Multisite medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research. The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data utility. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely upon bespoke data sharing contracts. The lengthy process and administration induced by these contracts increases the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research.  This paper provides a synthesis between 2 novel advanced privacy-enhancing technologies---homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (defined together as multiparty homomorphic encryption). These privacy-enhancing technologies provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with multiparty homomorphic encryption providing a performance advantage over separately using homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation. We argue multiparty homomorphic encryption fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using multiparty homomorphic encryption can be considered anonymized data. We explain how multiparty homomorphic encryption can reduce the reliance upon customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research while offering additional incentives for health care and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.},

  abstract = {In recent years, all major consumer technology corporations have moved into the domain of health research. This `Googlization of health research' (`GHR') begs the question of how the common good will be served in this research. As critical data scholars contend, such phenomena must be situated within the political economy of digital capitalism in order to foreground the question of public interest and the common good. Here, trends like GHR are framed within a double, incommensurable logic, where private gain and economic value are pitted against public good and societal value. While helpful for highlighting the exploitative potential of digital capitalism, this framing is limiting, insofar as it acknowledges only one conception of the common good. This article uses the analytical framework of modes of justification developed by Boltanksi and Th{\'e}venot to identify a plurality of orders of worth and conceptualizations of the common good at work in GHR. Not just the `civic' (doing good for society) and `market' (enhancing wealth creation) orders, but also an `industrial' (increasing efficiency), a `project' (innovation and experimentation), and what I call a `vitalist' (proliferating life) order. Using promotional material of GHR initiatives and preliminary interviews with participants in GHR projects, I ask what moral orientations guide different actors in GHR. Engaging seriously with these different conceptions of the common good is paramount. First, in order to critically evaluate them and explicate what is at stake in the move towards GHR, and ultimately, in order to develop viable governance solutions that ensure strong `civic' components.},

  abstract = {Background Sharing health data is challenging because of several technical, ethical, and regulatory issues. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have been conceptualized to enable data interoperability. Many studies provide implementation guidelines, assessment metrics, and software to achieve FAIR-compliant data, especially for health data sets. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health data content modeling and exchange standard. Objective Our goal was to devise a new methodology to extract, transform, and load existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR repositories in line with FAIR principles, develop a Data Curation Tool to implement the methodology, and evaluate it on health data sets from 2 different but complementary institutions. We aimed to increase the level of compliance with FAIR principles of existing health data sets through standardization and facilitate health data sharing by eliminating the associated technical barriers. Methods Our approach automatically processes the capabilities of a given FHIR end point and directs the user while configuring mappings according to the rules enforced by FHIR profile definitions. Code system mappings can be configured for terminology translations through automatic use of FHIR resources. The validity of the created FHIR resources can be automatically checked, and the software does not allow invalid resources to be persisted. At each stage of our data transformation methodology, we used particular FHIR-based techniques so that the resulting data set could be evaluated as FAIR. We performed a data-centric evaluation of our methodology on health data sets from 2 different institutions. Results Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users are prompted to configure the mappings into FHIR resource types with respect to the restrictions of selected profiles. Once the mappings are developed, our approach can syntactically and semantically transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility according to our privacy-concerned criteria. In addition to the mapped resource types, behind the scenes, we create additional FHIR resources to satisfy several FAIR criteria. According to the data maturity indicators and evaluation methods of the FAIR Data Maturity Model, we achieved the maximum level (level 5) for being Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable and level 3 for being Reusable. Conclusions We developed and extensively evaluated our data transformation approach to unlock the value of existing health data residing in disparate data silos to make them available for sharing according to the FAIR principles. We showed that our method can successfully transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility, and the result is FAIR in terms of the FAIR Data Maturity Model. We support institutional migration to HL7 FHIR, which not only leads to FAIR data sharing but also eases the integration with different research networks.},

First, limitations of available implementation technology may force a specification change. For example, deciding to implement a stack as an array (rather than as a linked list) may impose a fixed limit on the depth of the stack. Second, implementation choices may suggest augmentations to the original specification. For example, deciding to use an existing pattern-match routine to implement the search command in an editor may lead to incorporating some of the routine's features into the specification, such as the ability to include wild cards in the search key. This paper elaborates these points and illustrates how they arise in the specification of a controller for a package router.},

The results included increased government readiness to accept economic and political dependencies in return for efficiencies provided by large-scale infrastructures; decreased resistance among the general public to the private-sector takeover of what had been public tasks, and a corresponding lack of transparency about procurement and the alliances being made. We examine the features of these sector transgressions which make them difficult for civil society to resist, namely the instrumentalisation of privacy and data protection, the legalisation of transgressions through the decrease in regulatory controls, and the attractiveness to government of cheap and efficient infrastructural underpinnings to public services.},

Communicable and non- communicable diseases are increasing at an alarming rate and straining already overburdened and weak heath systems. Faced with a rapidly growing population, poorly equipped health workforce and meager resources to support the healthcare systems, there is a continuous search for tools to offer better healthcare in these resource constrained settings. ICT for development is one tool that has been adopted to improve access to quality healthcare for populations in resource constrained settings. While the tool has been shown to impact the health care sector positively, the use of ICT has brought in challenges of interoperability and usability of electronic systems in health. In this paper we investigate how Kenya has utilized ICT to spur development in the health sector and the measures she is undertaking to address these challenges. We advance that ICT for development is a tool that needs to be fully exploited by developing countries in order to bridge gaps in healthcare emanating from limited finances, poor infrastructure and an over-stretched healthcare workforce.},

Research suggests that perceived data quality and lack of feedback are contributing factors. We aimed to understand maternity care providers' perceptions of data and how they use it, with a view to co-design interventions to improve data quality and use. Methods We based our research on constructivist grounded theory. We conducted 14 in-depth interviews, two focus group discussions with maternity care providers and 48 hours of observations in maternity wards to understand maternity providers' interaction with data in two rural hospitals in Southern Tanzania. Constant comparative data analysis was applied to develop initial and focused codes, subcategories and categories were continuously validated through peer and member checks. Results Maternity care providers found routine health information data of little use to reconcile demands from managers, the community and their challenging working environment within their daily work. They thus added informal narrative documentation sources. They created alternative narratives through data of a maternity care where mothers and babies were safeguarded. The resulting documentation system, however, led to duplication and increased systemic complexity. Conclusions Current health information systems may not meet all data demands of maternity care providers, or other healthcare workers. Policy makers and health information system specialists need to acknowledge different ways of data use beyond health service planning, with an emphasis on healthcare providers' data needs for clinical documentation.},

However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

  abstract = {Background: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as ``Public Health \&amp; Research'' and ``Evidence-Based Medicine'' while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research. Objective: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions. Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. Results: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73\%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6\%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20\%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29\%, n=14), standardization of data (41\%, n=20), analysis (12\%, n=6), recruitment (14\%, n=7), and consent management (4\%, n=2). Most (55\%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55\% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63\%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29\%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37\%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18\%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12\%, n=6), and others (43\%, n=21). Only 4 (8\%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain ``Public Health \&amp; Research.'' Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server. Conclusions: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.},
